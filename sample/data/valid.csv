0c397195301736a6,"Your question was confusing. If you say that CH denial/support is a matter of faith, then it's like saying that the entire Global Warming article should be tagged as POV/faith subject as well, not just the denial article. You realize of course that this is not something feasible. Although I personally doubt man-made global warming, the subject has nothing to do with faith. It's about facts, data, and interpreting/analyzing/understanding the data (so long as the data is not false or misleading). There are scientists who oppose the mainstream opinion, and there are scientists who go along with the mainstream opinion in order to keep their jobs/position. Rather than a religion issue, it's more a political/financial issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Lincoln and Interstellar
You removed my proposals for deletion for both upcoming Spielberg films.  The template indicated, """"To avoid confusion, it helps to explain why you object to the deletion, either in the edit summary or on the talk page.""""  Since you did not do this in the edit summaries, do you mind explaining on the films' respective talk pages why these should not be deleted?  There is very little existing information about these films as of late, as opposed to some other upcoming film articles.  If your argument is not sufficient, I will promote these articles for deletion.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0
