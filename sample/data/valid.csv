 Definition of Managment Consulting 

I've modified the paragraph discussing the types of firms to use the more narrow term """"strategy consulting"""" rather than """"management consulting"""".

Managment consulting currently has a very broad meaning.  IT, intellectual property management, law, and accounting all involve choices that can have a profound effect on the opportunities and resources of an organization.  In current usage it seems that the term """"management consulting"""" refers to any sort of consulting activity that

 has strategic implications for the future
 requires senior or upper level managment champions and buy in

To distinguish a Bain from a PWC we need to focus on difference between strategy and implementation.  Strategic IT, strategic IP management, and management accounting and other """"new"""" forms of consulting all have a blend of implementation and strategy in common.

I think what distinguishes a Bain from a PWC is Bain's exclusive focus on the strategic elements of a problem.  Bain will tell you why you need to do something and some general ideas of how given your current resources but leave the rest to you.  Firms like PWC and  Proudfoot have built their reputation on taking at least joint responsibility for the implementation.

Hey brownaddictUK, welcome to wikipedia. I've noticed that you put the www.helpingaddicts.net link on a couple of pages that I watch over, and wanted to give you a quick heads up on editing wikipedia.  as you've probably noticed, a lot of the links were pretty quickly removed by editors because this isn't the place for them.  I'm all for harm minimisation & abstaining from addictions, but this is a place to provide factual information on subjects.  To put a link to an external link to a website, it has to have some further specific information about a subject, or for the purpose of verfiying information in the article.  The website you added doesn't fit either of these categories.

But i would like to invite you to contribute factual information to wikipedia, judging by the list of articles you added the link to, you seem to have a fairly good knowledge of drug related issues, maybe you could share that by contributing to articles.

I'm a reasonable and civil professional. Address me in a civil tongue or don't address me at all.

For example, one of these falsehoods covers the notion that the Welsh population is huge in Argentina when in reality it is not as significant at all in numbers as the author of the 'Argentina' piece makes it out to be. Another false notion within the same piece - both explicit and implied - is that Italians are the majority ethnic race in Argentina, when again, the numbers show this is not the case. These and other idiocies which aren't true exemplify the need to update the info therein. Third of all, I read your bio. With all due respect, according to your ethnic background, you're not qualified to dictate the origins of other nation's histories, especially Euopean. I know my English and Spaniard history. You don't. I may sound like I'm talking out of line here, but seriously, I'm not. Don't take offense as I state the facts as I see them. This is why modification is necessary.

No worries; I'm glad it could be resolved so quickly. It seems delicious carbunkle believes that it should have remained at WP:AN as it may be of interest to admins in general, but I've advised him to to make a separate post to WP:AN if he feels that way, as I don't think it's fair to single you out if he does believe that all admins should be reminded (i.e. that you're not the only one who overlooked this earlier consensus against blocking for having nipple in usernames).

The cartoon drew criticism for its alleged use of classical European anti-Semitic libels under the pretext of criticizing Israel. Others, regarded it as legitimate political criticism.The Independent's Press Complaints Commission (PCC), in response to complaints of anti-Semitism, found that paper had not breached its code of practice in publishing the cartoon.

bf6c806d7b2296fa,"""No. This needs to be here for all the colored people (for want of a better term - I'm still thinking about a better term) who read this article. They receive the affect of the words and they need to propose the alternatives. Put in simple terms that everyone can understand - males define the things that constitute masculinity and women define the things that constitute femininity. Lad mags are not written by women and Elle is not written by men. In other words those who are of the """"thing"""" itself usually occupy the best position to discuss the """"thing"""" (you can replace """"thing"""" with any term you want - airline pilots, hockey players, turnip growers, bee keepers, etc). This is not a guideline issue - this is a universal issue that affects us all but doubly affects those described as such. To remove this to a Guideline Talk Page would be counter-productive. For example: If the Suffragettes had not made the issue of votes for women visible to the wider public through highly visible protests including hunger strikes, imprisonment, direct action which included breaking laws (read: guidelines) then ALL women would not have the vote. There is no need for self-immolation as the Tibetan monks have done to highlight their continued oppression under the Chinese authorities - we just need to set this article alight.

Speedy deletion of Kaleb Young
 A tag has been placed on Kaleb Young requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  | Talk  """,0,0,0,0,0,0
