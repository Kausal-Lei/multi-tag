 ==Orphaned fair use image (Image:Ltsi.jpg)== 
 Thanks for uploading Image:Ltsi.jpg. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a claim of fair use. However, the image is currently orphaned, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see our fair use policy). 

 If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any articles will be deleted after seven days, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you.   
 == Image:Prespn.jpg == 
 Thanks for uploading Image:Prespn.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please: 

 # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. 
 # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. 

 Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. 

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Throughout the entire postwar period, 30% or so of Italians considered themselves communist, forming the largest single bloc, but were almost entirely shut out of national power because the other parties would form almost any alliance so long as it didn't include the PCI. When the PDS was formed, it was not for them a mere name change; many of them felt completely at sea.

 Thanks for your helpful comments in the arbitration enforcement thread. 

 That said, I was wondering if you had any advice for me about where to go from here. I trust your opinion and respect your involvement in these articles a lot, and I'm still a novice here with a lot to learn. One of the clearest messages I got from the arb enforcement thread was that when I see something that I think should be reverted, I should just revert it myself rather than expecting someone else to do it. Do you think that's acceptable for me to do at this point? I definitely don't want to step on anyone's toes, but I care a lot about beginning to contribute to these articles in productive ways. 

 I also have some other ideas of things I can do that I doubt anyone would have a problem with, like adding some references to the section on mental chronometry. If you have any other suggestions about things I can be doing to help out, I'd be interested to know. 

 I'm a little concerned that I'm going to end up inadvertently acting in a way people associate with Occam, even if it's for a completely different reason, like happened recently with my comments on Victor Chmara's page. If you notice me doing something like this, would you mind pointing it out to me? I'd hate to repeat a mistake like this completely accidentally.  

 I'm aware that I'm going to be heavily scrutinized for a while here, and I'll probably be having to walk on eggshells for a bit. Any advice on how to keep in line while still contributing to these articles would be appreciated a lot. -",,,,

 === North Cyprus Page - Edit Request - Kulaksiz 5 Case Section & Economy Section === 

 Dear Alessandro 57, 

 Thank you for your recent comments on my Edit Request for North Cyprus page. It seems clear that the text that I recommended needs to by shortened, as it is 'over weight'.  

 I am more than happy to shorten it, but I am having some problem in doing so, as I am not sure what my """"target"""" number of words or size of text is. 

 I have inserted the word file which includes both my original text, and then my 'references and consensus' additional request. Please do not think I am 'work-shy', I'm definitely not. However, I thought you may want to take a look, as perhaps condensing comes much easier to you, on the basis the Wiki language of every day country pages still isn't fixed in my mind. 

 Should you have any ideas or suggestions on condensing, or should you wish to have a go at cropping it, I would be grateful. It may save a lot of toing and froing as well. 

 I appreciate any time you can spare on the matter. 

 Kind regards 

 ToZero

 :::I think Trypt's proposal is an improvement over the current version that has become watered-down by misinterpretation of [[WP:NAD|""""wikipedia is not a dictionary""""]. I do have remaining concerns about saying """"atheism can be...simply the absence of belief that any deities exist"""" because this endorses that def (and the other 2)  each as adequate as another. Also, by just listing the defs rather than presenting them in a context, it actually makes the paragraph MORE like a dictionary. I know stating that there actually are multiple """"definitions"""" has become unpopular here recently, but saying """"Atheism has been defined as... the simple absence of belief that any deities exist"""" would remove any endorsement from any of the defs. (Btw, such would not state that there are no other defs.) Still Trypt's proposal is better than a euphemistic opening that says competing defs are merely """"describing"""" atheism. I do foresee future editors wanting to substitute """"is"""" for """"encompasses various forms of"""",  and even attempts to merge nontheism and atheism, and I do hope others will also be prepared to resist any such proposals.

 == Anti-SIAI Singularitarians == 
 You asked on my talk page for examples of Singularitarians who have opposed the Singularity Institute. There's a hanful on the SL4 mailing list. The most noticeable is Marc Geddes, who claims to have started his own competing AI project to initiate the Singularity, but he's more known for being completely insane than anything else. Russel Wallace wrote a proposal for an alternative to Yudkowsky's Friendliness model called Domain Protection. Over the next couple of months, he became increasingly critical and wrote that implementing Collective Volition """"would be arguably worse than just blowing up the planet"""" . In another post: """"If CV is ever on the point of being implemented, I strongly recommend having fast, thorough means of suicide ready to hand [...]"""" . I'm sure there are others, with varying degrees of opposition. Last I've heard, Ben Goertzel is making his own Seed AI and doesn't think Friendliness is as important as SIAI claims, but doesn't have any opposition to SIAI's success I'm aware of. I'm sure you could find more examples by looking through the SL4 archives. And sorry in advance if I've misrepresented Wallace's or Goertzel's views here, as they may have changed recently.

 == Fuck Truck == 
 You say """"please don't be so hostile"""". I'm sorry if I sound hostile. I think Wikipedia is a potentially valuable resource that is being trivialized in almost every corner by the addition of garbage. NOT: """"you are garbage"""", but """"fuck truck"""" is garbage.  

 It's interesting that you would use the word """"consensus"""" when in fact the result of the vote was """"no consensus"""". This is a fundamental problem with Wikipedia, in that the only people who CARE about articles are those who are passionately attached to trivia, so articles stand when no rational person could possibly believe in them. It's TRIVIA.  

 There's no possible way that this bus service is notable in any way, shape or form; most students of the institutions involved have never heard of it, let alone the wider audience. Be that as it may. The article was allowed to stand, stupidly. But the connection to the phrase """"fuck truck"""" has NO CURRENCY with anyone. The discussion made it clear that even among Wellesley students, almost none of them use the term. And Wikipedia is not for Wellesley students. Nor is it a repository for funny stuff that was in Rolling Stone. 

 The phrase """"fuck truck"""" illuminates NOTHING about the word """"fuck"""". It's not even the primary usage of the phrase! Admittedly, it's barely in the top twenty of things that are wrong with this article, but it is profoundly exemplary of those problems. Its inclusion is in reference only to the sniggering, would-be-transgressive trivial remarks. It doesn't illuminate any cultural trend; it doesn't say anything about college life; it doesn't say anything about the growth of language. It doesn't resonate, period. The redirect to the Senate Bus remains in place. But putting it here? It's funny. If you go to Wellesley. Period. 

 I'm not anti-""""fuck"""" (or anti-fuck for that matter); I've used the word in conversation more times than you've had hot dinners. I've even giggled over """"fuck truck"""" a few times  though not in reference to anything taking place in Cambridge or Somerville. I just want this article  and Wikipedia  to not suck so hard. Every day I look things up  important things  and they're not here. Why isn't the energy being directed there instead of jokes in """"fuck""""? Because this is the very definition of sophomoric. """"Fuck"""" is giggles, and an exaggerated sense of freedom. """"Fuck truck"""" is the kind of thing that belongs on Urban Dictionary or I Love Bacon or some such college-humor site. 

 So: keep your fucking fuck truck. But know that Wikipedia is just a little tiny bit stupider because of it. I'm not hostile, and I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. 

 ‚ÄîThe preceding unsigned comment was added by   ‚Ä? 24 April 2006  (UTC) 

 :Well, obviously I disagree. As a graduate of one of the insitututions served by the fuck truck I can tell you that it is a well known piece of collegiate lore. Beyond that, the term meets a conventional guideline for notability because if its inclusion in a national publication. I completely agree with you that the fuck truck is trivial, but it does seem that notability has been established (something can be notable and trivial  see wikipedia's extensive coverage of soap operas for example).  Moreover, if you read the article in question, you will see that it directly responds to your argument that the """"fuck truck"""" says nothing about college life. In fact, it says quite a bit about the experience of attending a single-sex institution such as Wellesley this day in age  the stereotypes, the inconvenience of co-ed socializing, etc. That said, if you really think the Wellesley College Senate Bus is so non notable, why don't you nominate it for deletion?   
 ::I won't nominate it because such a nomination has no chance of success. The vast portion of the population that has never heard of it and would regard its inclusion in an encyclopedia will never even see the controversy, and the only ones who care are partisans of the article. But it cheapens Wikipedia. How many other college shuttles are there in the world? Thousands? I know the University of Washington here in Seattle has one. I'm sure it has a funny nickname too  I wouldn't be at all surprised to hear that it's """"fuck truck"""". Should it be in the encyclopedia? No. But my experience has been it's almost impossible to get garbage articles out of Wikipedia because a significant percentage of Wikipedia editors prefer garbage. But more to the point of """"fuck truck""""  you can't be serious. The tragedy of Wellesley students' difficulty in procuring sex partners is possibly a matter of concern and in",,,,

c6c3b5e56b0bc766,"""War and weapons have coincided with eachother for many years, but the main flare for the development of weapons were in the medieval period.  There were any kinds of weapons, crushing weapons, swords, siege engines, cleaving weapons and ranged weapons. 

 Crushing weapons 

 A mace is the first crushing weapon that man actually fashioned, wether it is a simple club or an elaborate nobles flail it has exsisted for many centuries, this concept of weaponry has endured the sands of time and the furnace of warfare.  Flails are created first by the Danish people naming it the morning star, maces and flails can be flanged, or spiked, both of these can deliver peircing blows, also the warhammer is like a utility belt of a weapon, it can crush with one end and also grapple armor or peirce it with the spiked end making this easily one of the most versitile weapons on the medieval battlefield a nd also requires no sharpening or maintence at all  

 Swords 

 A sword, a deadly weapon on the battlefield and also a symbol of power of the noble who posseses it.  A sword took many many layers of fine thin steel and iron and often took years and years of work to create a fine sword.  A sword has long been a symbol of power and authority for many years.  It is one of the most refined weapons on the medieval battlefield.  But during the age of guns the grewat bastard swords and great swords were replaced with the thin thrusting rapiers.  A great sword is usually 5-6 feet long but with a good long hilt for two hands and a pommel that balences properly it only feels like 2-5 pounds in your hands. 

 Siege Engines 

 Siege Engines were used for attacking castles but less on the battlefields.  Siege weapons threw rocks, dead poeple to spred desieses but also flaming pots of tar.  A balittlai is a giant crossbow with a huge quarrel or bolt as ammunition, a mongel was not very accurate and didnt work when the ropes got wet, it looks like a spoon launching rocks,  a thrunchbuet is much more powerful and accurate, the counter weight for this seesaw like weapon is 80-100 times the weight of the rock being thrown for the power to tear a castle to peaces.  Also there were battering rams, covered with wet animal skins to defend the people working it, a wooden pole with a metal tip to break through doors and rocks.  Also a scaling ladder was used to climb the walls. 

 Cleaving weapons 

 Usually an axe, this was good for breaking armor and shields.  The vikings had elaborate designs on their axes to symbolize the wealth of the owner.  A broad axe and throwing axes like the franshisca are germanic throwing axes. 

 Ranged weapons 

 The Bow and Arrow easily come to mind when a topic like this comes up.  But there were also slings, staff slings and crossbows.  The sling was probably invented by acident, a neanderthal man probably didnt was to lose the rock and tied to to leather thongs and accidentally threw it and it outreached anything a human arm can do, then the next challenge was to keep the sling and let the rock fly.  This was just a loop around one finger and letting the other end go.  Also the later staff sling was invented which was even farther than the sling, it works the same way but attached to a staff for more range.  The crossbow will be the next weapon I will introduce.  It is simply put a hard wood bow in a T shape.  A crossbow string is winded with a winch.  A crossbow can easily outrange a longbow and also penetrate armor more deeply, it also can be used more easily by less experienced soldiers.  The downside is that it takes a while to load while and experienced longbowmen can get 7 arrows into the arrow before the first landed.  There were many bows the composite bow, the longbow, and the short bow, also the slef bow.  The composite bow was by far the most powerful at a record of 900 feet while the famed longbow only at 400 feet.  The """"english longbow"""" was actually made by celtic nobles.  Since a bow look a long time to make it cost a lot and was hard to get.  A noble usually rented his bows to serfs for a year to practice for war.  This then became a law to practice archery on the village green after church on Sundays.""",,,,

 ==Archiving== 
 Can you please restore the archived material which is still the subject of current debate. Archiving is for material which is finished with. There is an ongoing discussion on AN/I directly relevant to this material. Additionally Guinnog's request to remove """"propaganda against the 9/11 truth movement, particularly the images ridiculing the researchers"""" remains outstanding. Thank you.   

 == Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/Incidents#User:Morton_devonshire == 

 I have studied the report of this incident carefully, and would like to draw your attention to three points. 

 *  has made a number of comments to you, most recently ; while you have addressed some, it wiuld be helpful if you could deal with all of them. 
 * You have accused  of acting from a personal grudge. This violates WP:AGF and possibly WP:NPA, and I trust that you will withdraw the remark. 
 * As Tyrenius has pointed out above, it is most unhelpful to archive material relevant to a current discussion; please restore it immediately. 

 I am not taking sides in any factual dispute.  My sole concern is to ensure that Wikipedia etiquette is followed and that we all proceed calmly and without inflaming each other.  If you are unable to do so, I shall of course ensure that the correct procedures are followed.  I shall also leave a note on Tyrenius' talk page.  

 :Hi.  I‚Äôve seen the edits that Tom Harrison made to Controlled demolition hypothesis for the collapse of the World Trade Center with respect to Steven Jones, and I like his version much better.  Thanks.  Also, I have taken into account the suggestions some of you have made, and have altered my user and sub-user pages accordingly.  I decline to get into content wars with Admins.  I apologize for being direct, but being an American, that‚Äôs my way: I don‚Äôt wish to be involved in continued sessions of dialogue, and choose to disengage to calm things.  I hope that you will respect that.  Cheers, and happy editing!

The [[verifiability theory of meaning|verifiability criterion of meaning]] did not seem verifiable; but neither was it simply a logical [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], since it had implications for the practice of science and the empirical truth of other statements.

In the first place,  and the return, as it were, to salient aspects of Carnap's 1928 conception.  Schlick (1931) thus followed Wittgenstein's own suggestion to treat them instead as representing rules for the formation of verifiable singular statements. ( is indicated only in Schlick 1936a.) A second element that began to do so soon was the recognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms to observation terms... A third element was that disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability or support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was nomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth element, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the criterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it was to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick retained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages throughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological possibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned with natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements meaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a procedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only, Carnap (1936-37) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it was nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation of disconfirmation.Many of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in 1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous criterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that were syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were reducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence statements of science. {{big|{{red|While Carnap's focus on the reduction of descriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some statements, his criterion also allowed universally quantified statements to be meaningful, provided they were syntactically and terminologically correct}}}} (1932a, ¬ß2).

Independently, {{big|{{red|Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope}}}} that all theoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base by such reduction chains. {{big|{{red|This admission raised a serious problem for the formulation of a meaning criterion}}}}''': how was one to rule out unwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly abstract scienti",,,,

 :Well technically, the census was published in 1959. So the 567,000 figure is the official number of the 1957 census. However, due to the political issues that concern northern Iraq, many Kurdish and Arab scholars pushed for a corrupt census. Thus, the government claimed to have counted 136,800 Turks. Nonetheless, I have also placed this into a footnote in the info box of the article. 

 :The problem is that there is not much academia on this community. I have tried to look for journal articles via my university institution and could not find even one online-journal article. Thus, sources are very limited.  Nonetheless, even the sources which  has used, supports what I am telling you here. What Takabeg did was type """"136,800"""" into a google search and just placed whatever they could find into the article without actually reading them (see for example this link were Takabeg wrote in the search engine """"only 136800"""" ).  

 :So to sum up this confusing census debate, the 1957 census counted 567,000 Turkmens. However, due to political issues, the Iraqi government claimed that there were only 136,000 Turks. Furthermore, a year later they admitted that the very same census actually counted 567,000 Turkmen (more than 400% from the previous year‚Äôs claim). The census itself was published in 1959. Thus, the published census says that there was 567,000 Iraqi Turkmen in 1957 not 136,800.  """,,,,

b104c63f31805810,"*I think the current guideline on cite templates (neither encourage nor discourage) is sound. The problem is that many editors are not aware that this is the case, and we need to aggressively discourage the idea that citation templates are required or better than hand-written ones. On the other hand, I think citation templates have a few benefits, and we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater here; moreover, I seriously doubt that editors would unconditionally agree to even discourage citation templates, let alone ban them. This issue is more important and far-reaching than date autoformatting, and we all know how much time it took to change the status quo on that issue.Personally, I don't mind citation templates, and use them often, but would not be bothered if I couldn't use them. I think the more successful path is to strongly encourage moderation: don't provide more information than necessary, and prefer citations at the end of paragraphs rather than after ever sentence.

Of course, every car name is marketing; what I was trying to explain is that Lincoln called it the Continental Mark to make poeple think of the 1956 Continental Mark (which wasn't a Lincoln!) because that car was at the time as expensive Rolls-Royce; Lincoln thought- """"let's take that name so our new '68 coupe sounds like that ultra-luxury car from 1956.

 For the deal, the 451 Group analyst Brian Daley (Brenon Daly) that this will not be too much for Google Apps from the role. Salesforce.com for sales staff, their sales Salesforce.com software will be prize money, while sales of Google Apps is not any good.  

 Therefore, in order to control the sales channels Salesforce.com, Google must control Salesforce.com. In fact, many analysts believe that, Google is taking action on the Salesforce.com matter of time before.  

 Currently, Salesforce.com is the market value of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars. Daley, Salesforce.com premium of 23 percent is acceptable, that is 10.5 billion U.S. dollars. For the money, Google can use cash to pay for, and the remaining hands.

 Not really knowing the rules on inclusion, I don't have any firm opinions on whether or not the Irgun should be included in the Resistance Movement category. Supporters of the Irgun would obviously see it as a resistance movement. Opponents, which, at the time, included the majority of the Zionist movement as a whole, probably wouldn't. Arthur Koestler, the author of Promise and Fulfilment, counted as one of the Irgun's supporters. I can't remember whether he was actually a member, but he actively worked for the Irgun. Promise and Fulfilment isn't a great source. It was published in 1949 before much of what is known today came out. Therefore it reports propaganda as fact. It is also very biased. Koestler either didn't understand all the points of view or didn't want to present them.

 #There is a discrepancy among reliable sources as to whether Hak Ja Han is Sun Myung Moon's 2nd, 3rd, or 4th wife.

The above sentence is the best way to do this, and the above sentence is backed up to multiple sources which satisfy WP:RS and WP:V.

 == V-22 Osprey == 
 There is an V22-Osprey in the movie Megafault. 
    

 :It is a significant part or just a couple of minor appearances? Do you have a reference for this? -    

 One of the first known popular-culture appearances of the V-22 Osprey was in Half-Life from 1998: 
 http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Osprey 
 And it's differences in appearance are on trivia part here: 
 http://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Osprey 

 Can't realy see whats the point of 18:44, 8 December 2010 changes? 
 This whole article seem to be mostly about minor movie sigthings and somewhat resembling Transformer toys. I don't think the V-22 Osprey has played bigger part on any other game than HL. 
    

 :The edit you are querying just moved the text and tagged it for a ref. The two refs you cited are both wikis and therefore not acceptable under WP:SPS. By consensus all uncited and tagged text gets removed every Friday from this article, so if you have a real reference please add it before tomorrow. -    

 == Might need to look at what constitutes a notable entry again == 
 I just took a look at some of the current entries and there are some that seem pretty trivial (sourced, but not too notable sounding). I know the original criteria we decided to go with was that it needed to be a notable appearence. Are we going to modify that to now include cameos or any appearence at all?    

 :True, we do seem to be sliding into the """"incidental"""" or even """"trivial"""" mentions, like the tail of the B-52 in Apocalypse Now. Any suggestions for level of notability or quantity of appearance? -    

 ::I'm not sure how to precisely quantify it, but we need to exclude appearances where the aircraft is just seen/mentioned and has no real role in the movie/book/other work. -   

 :::I'll follow y'all's lead.  If you think that I'm being too inclusive, I'll be happy to modify the criteria for picking the entries.   Mark Sublette   
 ::::Went ahead and struck the B-52 listing for Apocalypse...   Mark Sublette   
 :::::Mark: you are doing great work there, but I think the B-52 in Apocalypse Now was pretty minor and incidental. Jeff has a good thought in that we need to cut out just incidental appearances or else this could be a very loooong article! -    
 ::::::I copy, five by five! )    Mark Sublette   
 :::::::What we talked about initially is that the aircraft either had a prominent role in the fictional work or was pivotal to the story. Cameos, part of an aircraft and things like that would not make that criteria. The example I used was Black Sheep Squadron.....F4U's, very notable. The C-47 that ferried supplies in once in a while, not so much.    
 ::::::::I agree that remains a good criteria for inclusion. Any disagreements? -

Schumacher understates his case in titling this book A Guide for the Perplexed; what he undertakes is to provide nothing less than a Manual for Survival, concerned not merely with individual physical or even societal endurance (though that, too), but more importantly with the full realization of human potential. Does that sound impossibly ambitious? It's only the beginning. In the process of articulating his view of life, Schumacher proceeds to knock the foundation from under much of what science has been about these past few centuries, and then to bring into synthesis the definitive tenets of the world's major religions. All this  and more  in only 140 pages. But hold the snickers; the man pulls it off. Compelling reasoned and persuasively presented, this Guide diagrams a view of humans and the world in which they live that will challenge and stimulate every thoughtful reader."""" 

 Theordore Roszak writing for the Los Angeles Times said that """"A Guide for the Perplexed offers us a harvest of utterly insane, consoling , and life-affirming insight from one of the wisest minds of our time. It is and unapologetic defense of traditional Christian humanism which I am certain will light many a darkened path.""""  

 The Chicago Tribune wrote that """"A Guide for the Perplexed is really a statement of the philosophical underpinnings that inform Small is Beautiful.

 == Married name not """"Rosazza"""" == 

 Recent additions to the article state that Alderson's married name is """"Joan Alderson-Rosazza,"""" in apparent reliance on an Australian book, Sports Around the World: History, Culture, and Practice, by John Nauright.  This is factually incorrect.  Alderson's married name was Joan Braskamp, following a socially high-profile and well-reported 1954 marriage to naval aviator Bernard Braskamp, the son of the chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Naughright's book evidently conflates the names of two different American swimmers, Jody Alderson, who won a bronze medal in the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay at the 1952 Olympics, and Joan Rosazza, who won a silver medal in the same event at the 1956 Olympics.  Alderson and Rosazza are two completely different women, with different birth dates, birthplaces and educational histories.  I'm not sure where the confusion began, but this is not the first time these Wikipedia articles have muddled the two women and their names.  For the record, I can find no sources that Jody Alderson ever married anyone named """"Rosazza,"""" and there are numerous sources for the Alderson-Braskamp marriage.    """,,,,

 Hi, 

 You've asked a question I never thought would arise, and it makes me worry for your sake a little  Wikipedia might be getting to you! ;) 

 The name had no meaning or signification for me at all when I concocted it (whilst intoxicated no less!)  Originally, I pronounced it  """"ZOH"""" (as in Zodiac) - loz (as in the Wizard of Oz.)  A friend later suggested that another possibility.  Take a music (or a Han) """"Solo"""", pluralize it: Soloes, and change the intial sound to a Z.  ZOH-lows, I guess I'd write that. 

 I am a rather odd fellow, as is well-known, so this is what I decided.  The first use of Xoloz by me was NOT on Wikipedia, but elsewhere.  To distinguish between this other use and my Wikipedian name, I use the """"original"""" pronunciation (The Wizard of...) for non-Wikipedian purposes, and the more recent suggestion when referring to the Wikipedian. 

 Aren't you glad you asked? ;)  My answer gives further insight into the depths of my insanity; I am proud of myself, though (and pleasantly surprised), that I managed to keep my explanation of the name this short.

 You need to stop reverting valid edits on this article.  

 *If someone edits in some new info, you have come along and re-worded it because you didn't like the way it was originally typed. 
 : ie The plot that was recently added. 
 *Which brings me to editing a plot synopsis, it's stupid. It has come from the production company and is usually the text printed on the back of the DVD. No one cares if you don't like the way it's set out. 
 *You edit text that others have added so the original meaning is lost 
 :When I added the info about the DVD/BD release date, I originally had it set out to say to to say that the """"DVD and the first Bluray in the series history would be release on...."""" but you changed it to """"For the first time in the series history, the episode will be released simultaneously on DVD and Blu-ray"""" which implies that there has been previous BD releases, but wasn't released the same time as the DVD. 
 * You make up rules to justify your edits/reversions.  
 : Retailers are valid sources for DVD/BD release dates, they get the information from the distributor who gets it's from the production company. Using your logic, any DVD that is not confirmed in a press release (since you also regard fan-sites as invalid) is not allowed to be mentioned on Wikipedia until the DVD has actually been released. They are accepted across many other TV show articles. 
 : You've named Twitter an unreliable source. Even if the Tweets that are being used as a reference are coming from accounts that are confirmed to be Seth MacFarlane or Kara Vallows. Information from these tweets may not have a """"proper"""" source for many, many months resulting in missing information that could have been present. Again, tweets are accepted on other articles given the account is confirmed. 

 Get over yourself and accept the fact this article is going to be 100% the way you want it to be. I will make sure I revert any stupid edits you make from now on.""",,,,

 == Personal Attack, silly vandalism == 

 Hi Alison, 

 User  inserted stupid statment here saying that the Gulf is also called """"The American Gulf"""" in Arabic. I reverted his nonsense difined as Silly Vandalism and  him in his Talk Page not to do so as he is established user in WP and supposed to know this before inserting jokes in articles. 

 *Firstly, and just for the sake of """"revenge"""", he tag my Talk Page with meaningless rubbish  without pointing why it has been used for, which is clear Personal Attack and damaging in my Talk Page Wikipedia:No talk page spamming. 
 *Then, he deleted the Warning from his Talk Page  that is clear vandalism according to Wikipedia:Removing warnings. 

 So, I would like to to take an action in: 
 # Removing the trash he filled my Talk Page with 
 # Punish him of doing so 
 # Punish him of removing a legal warning of vandalism according to WP rules, for special the Silly Vandalism. 

 Kind regards,  """,,,,

Also, the intro as it currently reads: """"Marriage is an interpersonal relationship ..."""" is ungrammatical. """"Marriage"""" is a concept and a social practice.

But as mentioned in footnotes there, the quartet does not have a publication nor premiere shown in Burghauser. If so it seems it was not yet defying the Emperor. Of the fourteen quartets, no. 3 is one of those (2,3,4, snd 6) without a current WP article. So it seems to have attracted little attention.

Eventually the CBC canceled showing the series in 1972 (  ) resulting in street protests that Eric Idle mentions in an interview many years later (  ).  The first Americans (in the U.S.) therefore to see it broadcast were those living close enough to the Canada-US border to receive one of the first CBC transmissions.
