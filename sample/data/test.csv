 As usual in any article concerning club matches between Scottish and English clubs the illusion is made that there are only two teams in the Scottish League: Rangers and Celtic. My own home team, Dunfermline Athletic, notably knocked out Everton in the 1962-63 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and West Bromwich Albion in the 1968-69 European Cup Winners' Cup. Why this constant bias towards the Old Firm?  Williamgeorgefraser",,,,

 ==Orphaned fair use image (Image:Ltsi.jpg)== 
 Thanks for uploading Image:Ltsi.jpg. The image description page currently specifies that the image is non-free and may only be used on Wikipedia under a claim of fair use. However, the image is currently orphaned, meaning that it is not used in any articles on Wikipedia. If the image was previously in an article, please go to the article and see why it was removed. You may add it back if you think that that will be useful. However, please note that images for which a replacement could be created are not acceptable under fair use (see our fair use policy). 

 If you have uploaded other unlicensed media, please check whether they're used in any articles or not. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """""""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images not used in any articles will be deleted after seven days, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you.   
 == Image:Prespn.jpg == 
 Thanks for uploading Image:Prespn.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please: 

 # Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template. 
 # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. 

 Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. 

 If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link]. Note that any fair use images which are replaceable by free-licensed alternatives will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.  If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,,,,

 In Super Mario Galaxy, you fight Bowser in a galaxy that you can reach from The Fountain. And when you attack his burning tail he spins away. But did anyone notice how his spikes retract? It's pretty strange a thing to happen if you ask me, but I won't put this info in the article unless someone else wants to. So respond if you want.  ]] 15:27, 2 January 2008",,,,
