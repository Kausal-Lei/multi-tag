How many more thousands of words are needed to get us to a conclusion? I don't think we'll ever get there without active mediation. One lesson we've learned is that getting a consensus among only some of the editors is useless if, at the last moment, another editor suddenly pops in and wants to start over from scratch. So for a Skype chat to be effective it would have to involve all of the active editors, editors who are spread across the globe. Rather than more words faster, could fewer words discussed more slowly succeed? That is, you putting out a question and waiting for everyone to agree to a formulation before moving on to the next point, slowly building up material with complete, explicit consensus among all active parties.

 -It's clearly proven that the Wright Brothers flew before that Richard Pearse guy. 
 -New Zealand is renown for its snobbery in claiming that they invented everything, from nuclear physics to the ballpoint pen! New Zealand has invented useless crap like crumpet machines and they claim that anything """"even minutely associated with New Zealand"""" is a """"Kiwi"""" idea. 
 -I was absolutely shocked after the launch of the A380 Superjumbo in 2005. The European scientists, engineers and manufacturers had put so much effort into making the aircraft. Then along comes the snobbish New Zealanders, who claim that (a) they invented flying and (b) that NZ should deserve credit for the A380 as it used """"NZ aluminum in the wings""""!  
 -Marmite is not from New Zealand, it's from Great Britain. Vegemite is from Australia.  
 -As an intelligent Asian student in New Zealand, I had received resentment and hatred amongst the anti-intellectuals in New Zealand. It's true; New Zealand doesn't value intelligence like the United States [where I live now for college at UCLA].  
 -The """"Tall Poppy Syndrome"""" is also prevalent in economic circles. Wealthy people who've deserved their money for their hard work are frowned upon in New Zealand. To combat this, the government of New Zealand has an overly generous welfare system, in order to remove even small amounts of economic inequality.  
 -New Zealanders have an """"everything's gonna be alright attitude"""" and the country is useless in diplomatic circles, considering it contributes in a negligible effort in maintaining World Peace.

Incidentally, virtue ethics has largely been ignored as a serious ethical theory for quite some while utilitarianism is widely accepted among ethicists.

As a side note, from my experience, this modern heathen comparison is just one of many surrounding the Irminsuls and probably shouldn't given so much weight - just that it's been compared to the rune. 

 ::With that in mind, I wouldn't trust the Anglo-Saxon rune poem mention of the north star so much in place of Tiw as a god, it's been heavily Christianized (the Anglo-Saxons having been Christianized considerably earlier than the Scandinavians) and subsequently a lot of the Anglo-Saxon heathen lore we could have obtained from it seems to have been deboned. I think the name of the rune is enough for a direct connection (*tÄ«waz/*teiwaz) and considering that Tiw was such a major god prior to being dethroned by Woden in some way, it wouldn't be surprising if there was indeed such a connection between Tiw and the Irminsuls. Still, this is all speculation on my part and I wouldn't add any of it into the article without a source, of course.",
