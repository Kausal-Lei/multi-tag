 Your links at Fatal Frame 

I saw your request for help at Help talk:Page history and came here to see what the problem was.

The Wikipedia rules on external links are much stricter than many editors realise. In particular, most links to blog sites are not allowed. The automated program  has been taught to check all edits made by new users which add links. One of its rules is that if the site name contains the word """"blogspot"""" then the edit should be rejected. 99% of the time this works well, helping new users to learn the rules.
Once you had been warned by XLinkbot, it was not helpful for you to continue trying to add the link. This can eventually be seen as disruptive; hence the warning that included the word """"vandalism"""". The term is used at Wikipedia to include various types of disruptive behaviour, as described here.

Let's move forwards! I think your best bet would be to post to the article talk page, Talk:Fatal Frame, asking whether the link is an appropriate one for the article.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

2. Early Conservation Work (sub heading under career) This is my section for the project. 

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book The Men of the Last Frontier?which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

3. Conservation Work with Parks Board Canada (sub heading under Career)
Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owls beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  
His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

[edit]Conservationist Views (new heading)
His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loos States of Nature?Conserving Canadas Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smiths From the Land of Shadows,?and Grey Owls Pilgrims of the Wild?as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.

4. Conservation Legacy (sub heading under Posthumous recognition)
The inspiration his lectures, books and films had on the people who came into contact with them will be explored deeper by using the sources below, as this is an area of his life which is largely overshadowed by the controversy of his false indigenous identity.

Corridor skiing
I have added a """"{{prod}}"""" template to the article Corridor skiing, suggesting that it be deleted according to the proposed deletion process. All contributions are appreciated, but I don't believe it satisfies Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion, and I've explained why in the deletion notice (see also """"What Wikipedia is not"""" and Wikipedia's deletion policy).  You may contest the proposed deletion by removing the {{dated prod}} notice, but please explain why you disagree with the proposed deletion in your edit summary or on its talk page. Also, please consider improving the article to address the issues raised. Even though removing the deletion notice will prevent deletion through the proposed deletion process, the article may still be deleted if it matches any of the speedy deletion criteria or it can be sent to Articles for Deletion, where it may be deleted if consensus to delete is reached.

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty. You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as """"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' Theres a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qwortys comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedias internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.""""

Those aren't my words, regarding you. They are Salon's. THEY have identified you as an apoplectic, vengeful disgrace, with an unhealthy scatological fixation. So, that's what we're dealing with here: you, Qworty, as the star of an article entitled """"Wikipedia's Shame.""""

Now, Wikipedia requires that we assume good faith in our fellow editors, which I do, until the most extreme (and frankly comical) evidence points out that we're dealing with someone like you. Since we know that you will do everything within your power to sabotage any entry remotely related to Filipacchi, it's a waste of time to discuss matters of policy with you. I'm happy to debate subtle points of epistemology with almost anyone, into the wee hours of the morning - just not with you.  As for Little green rosetta: I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even though she accused me - on the basis of what she termed """"behavioral and technical evidence"""" - of using sock puppets. Even though, when that proved to be false (okay, a lie), she didn't apologize, but instead came here to support your - Qworty's - frivolous snark. Despite all of this, I've given her the benefit of the doubt. Now shall we get back to the tedious matter of editing this article?

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.  But it is clear that no consensus exists and that the proper venue is the RfC where wider input can be obtained.-'''' Poppa Balloon'' """,0,0,0,0,0,0

13:27] == #wikipedia-en-help Cannot join channel (+b) - you are banned

A few days ago, I was in == #wikipedia-en-help, and PROTOSPAM, after insulting me repeatedly, determined that my questions were not """"helpful"""" or """"relevant"""" after I asked him a Wiki chatroom where editors/contributor can go to discuss general issues re: Wikipedia, not technical support which == #wikipedia-en-help is devoted to. I did not know that at the time.
Since then, PROTOSPAM has permanently banned me from entering the help chat room on Wikipedia

How long will this ban last? Is it permanent? If so, how am I supposed to get """"HELP""""? I'm new to Wikipedia, and I'm sure I ask a lot of dumb questions. I don't want to violate Wiki guidelines, but there are so many of them I make mistakes all the time.

There are a lot of authoritarian types in the help room and elsewhere on Wikipedia. Mlpearc and nonsenseferret both questioned my notability AFTER my Wiki profile was nominated for deletion in 2011 by bondeas and AFTER the decision: KEEP.

It's humiliating to have to prove one's notability...twice! After the 2011 recommendation to delete, I added more info that supported inclusion of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sanello. I believe that led to the KEEP recommendation.

Why have Wiki editors questioned my notability TWO years after I was declared """"notable,"""" which is never temporary, per Wiki's notability guidelines.
Thank you all very much.

There is not even one evidence to support the thesis that we were tengriists or that we called the god with the name Tangra/Tengri. In fact there is this evidence by the Persian scholar Al-Balkhi that says: """"I heard the Bulgarians call the Creator with the name Edfu and when I asked them how they锘?call their idol, they answered Fa."""" - Al-Balkhi, a persian scholar lived in the 9th century.
