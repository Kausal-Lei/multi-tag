Request to you
Hello, Mr. Naerhu. My name is Hatto. I live in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Please answer to me in Japanese language if you can write Japanese character by using your computer because it's easy for me to speak Japanese and I'm not good at English. I have a request to you. Its request is article's expansion and changing it to clean English! I'd like you to expand unfinished parts into complete article and make it clean because """"rough translation"""" tag is inserted in the article. Maybe, it's so bad English because some sentences are translated and added from references by myself. I tell you the article I request if you are interested in this request. Please answer.

Therefore, Machida Karate could be more Shotokan Karate than modern Shotokan Karate. Both Yoshizo and Lyoto had said similar statements. Finally, clich knees are in almost all martial arts with leg attacks including Karate, but due to the high risk of injury they are banned in sparring under most Karate masters especially when considering the most natural and best target for the knee attack is generally the groin area.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Stuart is David Stuart (Michigan politician), I presume. It looks like you may have overlooked Battle of Milliken's Bend. I don't have a particular interest in the subject, but you need to be careful of the controversy surrounding blacks in the Confederate Army. There is a current trend on the Internet to try to convince people that there were nontrivial numbers who actually fought in uniform (rather than slave laborers, cooks, Teamsters, etc.), but this theory is roundly denounced by virtually all credible Civil War historians. Gary Gallagher, for instance, has stated """"If there were blacks serving as soldiers in the Confederate Army, Robert E. Lee would certainly have wanted to know about it.""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Well, the politics in this Wikipedia are different with respect to the Spanish one. In there we had a discussin about its relevance, but we agree to redirect until the LFP (Spanish League) and the RFEF (Spanish Football Federation) says they last words about it, and said """"Without license, no allowed to compete"""", that's the problem: exists, but don't play football since the league begun, Still appear like """"Equipo 20"""", however, the Salamanca AC is (or was better said) the UD Salamanca's succesor after their disolution.

Hi, yesterday you made this edit at the Caesarstone article, removing a reference to Renaissance Capital that was there for verification purposes regarding information relating to Caesarstone's March IPO on the Nasdaq. Renaissance is often cited by the Naz's own online news reports, as well as by Reuters and other prominent outlets. The edit summary said """"WP:RS adsense spam,"""" but I'm uncertain as to what that means and how the reference qualifies as spam when it's there for the purpose of WP:V. I'll thank you to take a few moments to share the reasoning behind that edit with me, especially as my tendency is to revert it as a misidentification as spam of something that's intended as an innocent citation.?

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

I have always read the """"redirect from another language as being more related to things such as Kyiv (topical one that one - read the talk page! - but I digress), or Das Wohltemperirte Clavier rather than a literal transalation of every article's name in to other languages, particulary those with non-Latin character sets.  This is why I feel that the two (Mandarin?) words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the English language Wikipedia. But the bottom line is that I am one admin & one opinion (which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable). The redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. If they are renominated for deletion I will recuse myself from the process and we'll see what others think. Sound OK to you? Kind regards,  talk 
Well, there's the essay Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Redirects from foreign languages . The article's name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. (ie. It's a chinese spacesuit, the actual name is in chinese, not English).  From the bit about non-Latin characters, doesn't that indicate bias, since English is used in Hong Kong as an official language, where Chinese characters are prevalent, or India, where non-Latin script is common and English is widely used. But we already use a lot of implausible names that people would type",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Tram and trolleybus articles 

Thanks for your comments.  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport, particularly in continental Europe, since the early 1980s, and that, of course, is the subject matter of the newly translated template (and the articles that are and will be linked to it).

Until recently, en.wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have.  Although I can't speak Italian, and can barely read it, translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator.  Since November last year, I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations.  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en.wiki, the it.wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step.

Since I started work on my latest project, I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de.wiki, so I will start translating some of the de.wiki articles soon.  In the meantime, I have just created one very long overdue en.wiki article, Trams in Milan (not fully translated as yet), and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days.

Which brings me to a query about nomenclature.  There's quite a bit of material on both it.wiki and de.wiki about individual classes of trams (and trolleybuses).  However, I'm not sure how translations of those articles should be named.  If an article is about a generic make and model (eg Siemens Desiro), then it can just be named as """"make model"""".  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).  What do you think?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It seems to me that there's a major deficiency in this article, which is that it's not made clear what the connection is between a rotation matrix and the geometric operation of rotation  this connection being that if you premultiply a rotation matrix by a column vector, then the result is another column vector that is just a rotation of the first.

Okay, it is stated eventually, but not until the geometry section, and there only in the abstract language of linear algebra, putting the main point of rotation matrices out of reach of anyone except those who should know it already.

I'm hesitating to jump in and revise it, as I'm kind of new to linear algebra, but will probably go ahead and take a crack at it eventually if no one with more expertise wants to step up.

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it in a pro-JW website, trictly genteel? which transcribed the noted WT book s the Bible Really the Word of God?? and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That what stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And he World History of the Jewish People?   At least that he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill book says this:   

hen we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differencesiterary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to materialetween Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place nce upon a timen other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happeningt is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of timeeyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity concreteness of detail, a concern to get things righthat convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.?

Thanks for improving the article Ayaka Asai, which I created (together with Tomoyo Kurosawa and Moe Toyota) a few months ago. I noticed a very odd error though: her agency profile says that she had a role in the 2013 Pokmon theatrical short Pikachu and Its Eevee Friends as """"Glacia"""" (Glaceon). As a Pokmon fan myself, I immediately noticed some discrepancies: this website and the movie credits give the voice actress for the said role as Akeno Watanabe (itself an article needing immediate attention). I'm confused (in fact, the said role was included in my edit that created the article, but as you can see with this edit, I removed it for the reasons I mentioned above). could the agency have made a mistake?  tccsdnew """,0,0,0,0,0,0

{{unblock|That is absolutely false. I absolutely did not """"make a personal attack"""" on you. Dishonestly claiming a false pretext to block me is a reprehensible abuse of your authority. Since the stated reason for this one-week block is wholly spurious, absolutely false, I demand to be unblocked immediately.

Not only did I never make any """"personal attack"""" against you, admins will observe that I actually thanked and praised you for intervening, which I also did in my private email message to you. This pretext for a one week block is absolutely spurious. You're making a minor disagreement on a tangential point on the Talk page into something personal and abusing your authority.

As for your comments on the Talk page:

 I never accused you of making ad hominem arguments, I asked you to calm down  WP:DISENGAGE.

I was never not """"cool"""" to begin with, so it's unnecessary to tell me to """"calm down"""", """"cool down"""", etc. Moreover, you said to me: """"I see some efforts being made to try to work out the differences, they will not be worked out if you resolve to not negotiate and dig in your heels. Respectful discussion free of attacks is the best way to do this ..."""" This implies I had made """"attacks"""" on people in lieu of trying to negotiate a solution reasonably. But like I said, and as you seem to now acknowledge, I never employed any ad hominem arguments (i.e., """"attacks""""). Moreover, any administrator can go to the Talk page and see for themselves that I've gone to extraordinary lengths to negotiate a reasonable solution with other editors.

 You can be right about something and still be wrong  META:DBAD.

I don't know what it is you think I am """"right about"""" but still """"wrong"""" about. But you seem to be implying I'm being a """"dick"""". I challenge you to present any quotes from me evidencing your implication that I've been a """"dick"""", i.e. by making """"personal attacks"""". You'll find you are unable to do so.

 You have engaged in a level of rhetoric that has created a hostile atmosphere (WP:CIVIL), you refuse to relent from your positions and you attack the positions of others with walls of text and barbs (WP:DBF). You've had editors ask you to calm down and you've had admins ask you to calm down and yet you've attacked anyone who has asked you to  WP:NOTTHEM.

Again, this is a false characterization. Every response of mine to others arguments has been to address the facts and logic of their arguments, as I am doing here with you. I have in no way been uncivil either with you or the other editors engaged on the Talk page. I have discussed diverging views and made numerous concessions to others on the Talk page in order to come to a consensus. My replies to others on their positions have consisted of substantive responses on points of fact and logic, never """"personal attacks"""" or """"barbs"""" (""""walls of text"""" might apply, as I've gone to extraordinary length to outline my own views and to support my own arguments with facts and logic).

 # """"Unhelpful"""" is not a word.

Thanks for the correction. I'll reiterate: """"Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's not helpful. Cheers.""""

Incidentally, it is apparently this comment you here regard as a """"personal attack"""" against you. Any other admin can see for themselves I did not attack you here. On the contrary, I merely observed here that you had characterized ME as making """"attacks"""", when I had never done so. You're making this personal and abusing your authority.

 This is the first thing you posted immediately after your previous ban expired (WP:NAM) followed by open questioning of your ban even being valid, it appears you need more time to cool down, 7 days should do.

You have not substantively addressed even a single point in my argument why my previous ban was wrongful. Yet you block me further on an even more spurious pretext  this time an absolutely false allegation that I attacked you personally. Other admins can confirm I never once did so.

 If you come back from this block and engage in more vitriol here again I'll have no choice but to take further sanctions and ban you from editing or discussion on this article per WP:GS.

On your further mischaracterization of any of my remarks of mine as """"vitriol"""", see above.

I would request that whatever admin makes a decision on this that you please substantively address my points here. The stated reason for my being blocked for 1 week is that I made a """"personal attack"""" on Wgfinley. Admins will find that I have never once done so.

355a0a2cb2039565,"If you read the Oohashi paper, you will see the trouble they have gone to, to source ultrasonic music from gamelans, special playback equipment, special tweeters, etc .... everything checked from source to speaker system. Meyer Moran does not even seek to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not pretend to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not claim to be a test of ultrasonics. If you wish to assert that Meyer Moran is a test of ultrasonics, you will have to formally prove that EACH AND EVERY ONE of the elements of the chain passes the ultrasonic test. So let's check it out

1. Source material:  

This is discusssed at:  
http://www.sa-cd.net/showthread.php?page=1
It turns out that the vast majority of source discs used by Meyer Moran were recorded in the 50s, 60, 70s or 80s ... they are CD quality masters, and therefore do not have ultrasonic content.  
Summary: SOURCE MATERIAL:   FAILS ultrasonic test

2. The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran has to be able to reproduce ultrasonics. 
The source equipment used by Meyer Moran is listed at:
http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/explanation.htm
The principal equipment consisted of an Adcom GTP-450 preamp and Snell C/V speakers.

You can find the specs for the Adcom GTP-450 preamp here:

http://www.users.interport.net/a/d/adcom/gtp450.html

The specs are listed as: 20Hz to 20kHz.  FAILS ultrasonic test

The specs for the Snell C/V speakers are given here:

http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/1194snell/index3.html

They show massive drop-off above 22 kHz. FAIL

Summary:  The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran cannot reproduce ultrasonics properly.

GRAND SUMMARY:  Meyer Moran is not a test of ultrasonics. Meyer Moran do not claim it is a test of ultrasonics. The only person claiming that it is a test of ultrasonics is you, it is  your own original research, which is a violation of the Wiki original research provisions. Worse, your claim is  completely flawed and erroneous, at EVERY LEVEL of the chain, from source material through to speakers.

I'll leave this up for a day or so for some discussion. If you cannot prove your original claims, then ... out it goes.

P.S. Your Lehrman (2008) reference is just a quote of Meyer Moran - it also has absolutely nothing to do with hypersonic, or ultrasonics. You might want to take this to the CD advocacy page - but it has nothing to do with the ultrasonic effect. Out it goes. (  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Protestant revolt. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - The Reformation. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion.

If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at The Reformation - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
here are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.?(General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

Well, one issue at a time:
The last sentence of the 1st paragraph truncates the narrative by jumps from one subject (internal policy) to another (foreign policy), before falling from the sky after decades to following paragraph without even suggest the reason of 1920s military revolts (not to mention that even remotely touches the civilian ones).
To remedy the last flaw of this paragraph, and with citations (easy to check) in English (other section's defect: too many sources in Portuguese, one of them is not even specific to Brazilian history) and
before to deal with the 2nd paragraph [ one issue at a time ) ], I suggest to let the 1st paragraph fine and end the discussion about this paragraph, 
I propose that the mention concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries  in the early 20th century (even because, the border issue of Acre, in addition to not being the only one of that era, contained in itself a military phase, among others, having not been characterized or reduced to a mere purchase...), be placed at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph in the foreign affairs: 
 """"In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period,* was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations,* after its involvement in World War I.***"""" ; 
more or less eg as I had proposed, both with a neutral point of view and specific easily checking citations in english...

So, if you agree to it in relation to the 1st paragraph, I will talk about my suggestions of changes regarding the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs and (again) why of it...

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Rginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the linkhat's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source.

d5ef9dff36ac058f,"Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition.

Contested deletion

This article should not be speedily deleted for lack of asserted importance because... I am still learning how to add information to the profile, including accomplishments,press releases, etc. I wanted to start the page and continue to add to it. A note should be made regarding timeliness. Specifically, should a list of referenced accomplishments be aged? Should an activity occurred more than one year or more ago? The lack of specificity creates ambiguity especially as it relates to other businesses, sites, people, etc. who would like to be included in wikipedia if for no other reason than posterity's sake.

This was deleted because of advertising, but to answer your questions, press releases are not useful to show notability as they are not independent references, but they could be used to support facts in a page if you believe them to be true. We need two or more independent and reliable references with substantial coverage of the topic.  This is an encyclopedia so that old activity is just as important as recent.

The ability for growth is stifled. I have seen 99% of Maya books and articles use Ahau instead of Spanish Ajaw yet the editors of Wikipedia like to stand out as different. Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau. Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered.

1141d532b170240f,"I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:

>The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<

Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html

Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents.

 Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that """"American"""" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.

Hello FlugKerl.  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven.  It is great article and well-sourced.  I have just done a little copy-editing.  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft """"produced each year in North America exceeds ... """" and compares it with """"all commercial general aviation companies.""""  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about """"all commercial general aviation companies"""" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:
The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America.

Thanks for the input! I will correct the URLs and the terminology tomorrow.

If not, which I think is the case, I can set it up so this page redirects to a new page with the same article (blanking this one) called Solus Operating System, so long as that is available. If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons. Anyway, I am enjoying your OS. If you get around to it could explain to me what makes Solus its own OS rather than a Linux distro? Also, I understood that although you use Budgie, Gnome is behind it.

 I don think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word onsensus?it doesn matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

I know this is mean to peoples with small penises because your women will flock to us when they know the truth but TRUTH IS WHAT WIKIPEDIA IS BUILT ON! We are a proud encyclopedia and the only way forward into this non-white controlled future is by removing all clouds and exposing what you really have down there.

If you look at template:cite book you can see the parameters for a template that defines a cited book.  I always use this template (or others like template:cite journal or template:cite web) because they automatically put the different bits of information into the right format.  template:sfn gives a way to easily make a reference and footnote that link to the cited source, thus:

Displays as:

The trick here is that the """"cite book"""" template includes """"|ref=harv"""" which tells the template to make a footnote from the author's last name and the year of the book, e.g. """"Smith 2009"""", and link it to the book definition.  That may not always be possible, because the author's name and/or publication year may be unknown, in which case you can tell the template what name to use for the footnote, as in  |ref={{harvid|Norwegian Blue}}

I interpret silence as no contention, and have moved the item here:
It is not easier to balance an egg on its end on the first day of spring. In fact, the ease or difficulty of balancing an egg is the same throughout the year. This myth is said to originate with the egg of Li Chun, an ancient Chinese folk belief that it is easier to balance an egg on Li Chun, the first day of spring in the Chinese calendar. In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun. It was introduced to the western world in a Life article in 1945, and popularized once again by self-titled """"urban shaman"""" Donna Henes, who has hosted an annual egg-balancing ceremony in New York City since the mid-1970s.

The RfC I was referring to was the informal one on the article talk page; I notice no one has responded to it but we have all chosen the threaded discussion instead. I'm all for an outside discussion, but I'm thinking you may not approve of the Denialism category itself, which is a whole 'nuther argument. Have you checked it out to see what's in it? 
I think you may have missed what we are saying is being deniedevolution. We are not saying that to believe in God is denialism or that God is a fairy tale. I believe in God (Elohim, Jehovah, El Shaddai). We're saying that denying evolution is denialism of the accepted scientific theory. You wrote, """"While some editors have argued that this refers to ID's alleged denial of evolution. . ."""" Why """"alleged""""? I quoted Behe to you from the DI's website: """"Darwinism is false."""" That is patent denial of evolution. 
I agree with Cla88's post of 00:57, 28 February 2012. The first paragraph of the lede is deeply flawed, and probably the tone of the whole article is dismissive editorializing rather than objective presentation of the concept. I haven't read the whole thing at one sitting for a long time, so I'm not sure of that. The first paragraph is very confusing on the identity of the designer, which should not even be brought up there. (ID proponents, though, are themselves two-faced about this point.) This subject is very contentious and I despair of ever seeing a fully objective article. When I'm in Wiki-land, I do as the Wikipedians doadhere to the 5 pillars.
Also, I hope you've caught on that the specific variety of intelligent design of which this particular article treats is the ID of the Discovery Institute and its affiliates and sympathizers. (Can't think of a better word than sympathizerfollower, maybe; those who agree with and may promote the idea without actually being affiliated. The community church on the corner, for example.) That means everything will focus on the Johnson/Dembski/Behe/et al axis.

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.    (comment| talk)

 Well, I'll give you my opinion. I wrote the Intervals section, and I admit that I didn't write it well at all. It was one of my first Wiki contribs, and it sucked quite honestly. I would encourage someone to re-write it if they want to, or I will when I have time to mull it over and do it properly. However, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals. When two distinct (by which I mean different) pitches are sounded, the interval between them is what creates harmony. Harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. So absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant. However, the way in which I went about explaining it in my contrib wasn't so great. Again, I would encourage a competent and learned musician to do a re-write, or wait and I'll do it.  

 I will say one other thing, which is that Wikipedia is a learning reference, and will serve its best use to the public if Average Joe can come along and glean complete information from non-confusing articles. My ideal is this: say a churchgoing person, one who has very limited musical knowledge, wants to learn how to sing the alto/tenor/bass/whatever line in hymns, so that he/she can feel more """"one with God"""" on Sunday mornings. I want for that person to be able to look at this article, and come away with a clear idea of how harmonies work, so that he/she can practice singing them. The oneand onlything which creates the alto, tenor, and bass lines are the fact that they're pitched at an interval to the melody (soprano) line. Again, intervals and harmonies are one and the same. For the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies. That's why I think it's important to keep the section in question, but to rewrite it.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sarvagnya and others, why are you making a issue out of a non-issue. Mahawiki has given a valid citation and it is perfectly alright. He has e-mailed me the file, and I have myself read it. But, comin' back to the point, let me point out that all citations cannot be online. Offline citations are allowed in Wikipedia. If you still want to remove the citations, then it's your prerogative. But then rest assured, your Kannad author Mr.Kamat's references from all the articles that Kannambadi has kannadized will also be removed. So, please cool down your rhetorics as they ain't gonna scare Mahawiki or me. By the way, Sarvagnya, I  must point out that what you're doing is Wikistalking ! Isn't it ?

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one patriotism under control? That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

In addition to that Jordan signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt.""""

 that section right there. The """"As a result of such dramatic situation ..."""" you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed. Even in King Hussein's own book and through historical records its pretty clear jordan went to war not because of a threat of israel winning, but a threat that egypt and syria would win sidelining jordan big time.

At any rate i think it would be better not to context why the wars started etc. Focus on battles, etc. Most of the israeli incursions were also due to Israels concept of if Palestinian guerrillas attack to hit back at the arab militaries instead.

I disagree, as this article has had a history of people trying to add irrelevant material to it (such as the costs for proper supervision). If you review Wikipedia:Article titles it says (emphasis added is my own): """": Article titles should be recognizable to readers, unambiguous, and consistent with usage in reliable English-language sources."""" Also """"The ideal title for an article will also satisfy the other criteria outlined above; ambiguous or inaccurate names for the article subject, as determined by reliable sources, are often avoided even though they may be more common. For example, tsunami is preferred over the arguably more common, but less accurate tidal wave."""" Leaving it as just """"Kosher tax"""" has proven time and again to be too ambiguous, and so per WP:COMMON I maintain that Kosher tax canard is a better proper title.

 Paul Siebert 

This guy's just like a Holocaust denier in the way he masks his revisionism in casual and practical editing.  He recently removed the section by Sascha and commented that it was poorly sourced despite the fact that two of the sources are easily availible online, and another is from a book, which can also be found on Google Books if the page or quote is entered.  He's clearly grasping at straws.

Would anyone have any objections to sending out a mass text to undo his revisionism when he goes on one of his rampages?

  
He was correct. """"Poorly sourced"""" means that the added text was not supported by any sources mentioned in the article. If you want to add something with proper references, go right ahead. And in the future, please refrain from accusing a good editor of something as serious as """"Holocaust denier"""" when you know for a fact this is not true. I highly suggest not attempting some kind of attack on the article either. |  | talk | 

I was the original writer of the section.  I also received the same briefing on Paul Siebert from Alex before registering here.  First, the sources were mentioned in the article, if you're referring to the ones about Neo-Nazi historical revisionism, as I was talking about what Neo-Nazis say, and their revisionism.  Second, Paul Siebert, assuming what Alex told me is true, is a Holocaust denier, as he denied acts of genocide committed against Holocaust victims at the end of the war.  This can be confirmed in Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State and The Fall of Berlin 1945, both of which have been cited here by Alex.

 Response to Skinwalker's personal attack on  via a RFC  

Hi

This is a response to 's RFC on .

Rather than straight talking language, some folk prefer to use clever legalistic attacks on individuals such as the way that  is using on .

In the context of the Wiki, this is an ad hominem where his intellectual powers failed to persuade the consensus on the discussion page.

 failed to get his way with regard to muddying of the waters with anorexia just as   had done previously with the met industry's pollution. So what happened her is they conspired to attack  with the use of a meatpuppet called   employing all the trick they can like making false allegation, lying, official complaints and so on.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way. It is certianly a lot less intentionally insulting than to be continuously called a meatpuppet or, I am sure, for user Canaen to be accused of having some connection with me when he has none.

The funniest thing for me is that  is busy digging a hole in his own canoe because his allegations are outright lies of which he can in no way substantiate.

This conflict started because  insisted on posting data refering to anorexics on the Vegan topic which had no relationship to veganism whatsoever.

 is entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant. 

  is an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement.   has been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or the other individuals and yet he not only continue to go on making such allegations but   even uses them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.
 

This is where   boasts to Canaen he has made a complaint about him on Canaen user page ;

User conduct RFC

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you.  It can be found  here.  Cheers,  

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald.

Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context.

Well, I must of course sympathise with you to some extent, but really, I must far more urgently recommend that you hesitate to rely on lexicographers for cogent definitions of technical terms. Just today I had occasion to consult the internet facility of a very major dictionary, concerning """"parasitoid"""", a matter of which I have a modest understanding. Their definition was biologically illiterate. I agree that the OED text on """"Heat"""", to which you refer, might read more comfortably to the layman than our flowing (or non-flowing, as you prefer) stuff that we have been talking about, but really, OED or no OED, that text cannot possibly be acceptable in our WP article if we don't want to be a laughing stock, perhaps even a reproach and a byword, among our informed readership. It just won't do. Certainly you have a point in that what we have is heavy going to the innocent and with due deference to another author who eschews """"chattiness"""", colloquiality, and comprehensibility, I insist that we should include at least introductory material that the intelligent layman can understand, but not by presenting inaccuracies for him to understand.

Hi,
Your page is the ONLY reference I have found for removing the left sidebar.  Really excited about this.

Found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PleaseStand/Hide_Vector_sidebar

Can you expand on the install instructions?  I did not add it to 'User:myname/vector.js', but instead 'User:myname/common.js'.  This didn't exist before I created it.

Also why have the vector skin check at the end if it is added to the skin javascript directly?  I just realized I added it to global first, and the check did work.  Moving it over to vector.js now...

I fumbled through but expanded instructions may help others.

Also, the shortcut key does not work to un-hide on Macs.  Not that I want to unhide it...
I could not figure out what to edit in the code to change the shortcut keys.

It also loads after all of the page content, is there a way to load it before so the sidebar doesn't appear then disappear, or edit the skin directly?

Wikipedia is an """"encyclopedia"""" and as such, should reflect outside sources, not one's own POV. Not only that, Wikipolicy calls for PLURALISM which requires the articles to reflect major points of view, not just one. However, in this case probably the majority, if not a plurality, of sources reflect my POV. For example:

When ESPN lists the winners of Grand slams, they don't worry about issues such as Open era/pre-Open era, challenge round, or pre-1925 French.

All right, I may have to concede defeat here. Personally, I see the case as crystal clear, but it's the opinions of RSs that count, not my own. FTR, my textbook is The Historical Jesus by Theissen and Merz, 1996. They cite Dalman, Klausner, Maier, and Thoma. Individual scholars are bound to disagree, but does anyone have a disinterested secondary or tertiary source that describes the dispute at second hand? WP:WEIGHT says that when there are sources on opposite sides of an issue we look for second-hand descriptions of the dispute. And personally, if you think that Yeshu isn't Jesus, could someone name any historical figure that matches """"Yeshu"""" better? I would really change my mind if someone could explain who Yeshu is if not Jesus. He's s sorcerer named Yeshu (later identified as the Nazarene) who has disciples and who is executed around Passover? Who is that if not Jesus? If that's now how the Talmud portrays Jesus, how does the Talmud portray him?  (talk)

Acroterion, I don't believe I need to review or post what a broad cross-section of scholars have to say on the subject.  I believe a 5th or 6th grader could determine the relevance of the facts I propose to post.  

Plus, you are imposing an impossible standard in that most scholars don't state the obvious for obvious reasons.  Why should an accomplished scholar say 1 + 1 = 2 when everyone in his or her audience already knows the answer?  

Here's a reasoned conclusion a 5th or 6th grader could arrive at: Since Fisher's affiliation with the National Lawyers' Guild was already public knowledge, McCarthy didn't do anything wrong by mentioning Fisher was affiliated with the National Lawyers' Guild at the Army hearings. And Welch was wrong to denounce McCarthy for saying that.  I'm not proposing to say that, but the conclusions are inescapable for even a 10-year old.

I do not doubt your good faith, but your analysis and reason appear weak.  No one besides you has raised that objection.

Are there others that join you in raising that objection, because I'm not convinced anyone besides you believes that?

BTW, this appeared on the Army-McCarthy hearings site:  """"At the time Brownell was seeking to designate the NLG as a Communist front organization, and McCarthy mentioning Fisher's membership violated a pre-hearing agreement to not raise the issue as it was still being litigated.""""

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

It is not common (because almost every defendant in murder cases opts for a fast-track trial) but it may happen.

A fast-track trial is a trial where no actual trial is involved. I'll try to explain it. A criminal proceeding in Italy consists of many phases:
1. preliminary investigations;
2. preliminary hearing;
3. trial;
4. appeals.

After the preliminary hearing, the Judge only decides whether or not the evidence gathered so far is enough to sustain a case in Court. If so, he sends the defendant before the Judge of the Trial, where he will be convicted or acquitted; if not, the Judge sort of acquits the defendant.

A defendant can, though, choose to give up his right to a trial. He will be, then, tried by the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing, who will hand down a judgement, based upon the evidence gathered so far.

Since this is a reduction of the defendant's rights, it must be he who asks for a fast-track trial. In exchange for that, he is compensated with a lighter sentence. If there are two or more defendants, one may opt for a fast-track trial and the other choose to stick to the standard pattern. In this case, since it would be unfair (or so Italians think) to let the wishes of one of them take precedence over those of the other, the two defendants are tried separately, even though they committed the same crime.   14:05, 11",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've said it below earlier that he wasn't considered very famous in many parts in the world. So a citation is needed for the rock history thing. Because it's vague when you say just rock history, it would be fitting for Yoshiki to be the an influential drummer (maybe most, but that might need a citation as well) in rock history in Asia.  

So, when we say that Bonham is one of the most influentials drummers in the rock history, we have to say that his one of the most influentials drummers in UK and not in the rock history? =/, yeah, Yoshiki is the mots influential drummer of Asia, but Asia is also inside the rock history don't forget this ;)

 Only Japan? 

Somebody has just put that Yoshiki is one of the most influential drummers in Japan rock history, eehm, everybody knows that Yoshiki is THE drummer of Japan, and because of that is one of the most influentials in all rock history, not only in the rock history of Japan, if you see bands in China, Korea, et.c you'll see that their drummers are fans of Yoshiki.

Well, I guess not just Japan but in Asia. The reason to why I put that is because while Yoshiki is well-known in parts of Asia, he wasn't as influential in many countries like the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Sure, there are people in those continents that like him (and X-Japan as a whole), but it's not enough compared to the majority who hasn't heard of him or X.

 They've changed the image on their page, it seems. That's the site I got the image from, not the information. The site does not mention where on earth the Rouge Watershed actually is, which was my problem. If you know of a Rouge Watershed, and it is in Ontario, near Toronto, and you know that Highway 407 runs nearby there,  the image is almost definitely of a clearcut in the Rouge Watershed near Toronto. To be blunt, I pulled the info about it being Alberta out of my ass, simply because it seemed like the most likely Rouge Valley that Wikipedia had listed. That's it.

The wording of the most recent edit is needs tweaking.

And as stated by the Administration in 2012, there are were no plans for a complete withdraw; which had changed as recently as recently as this month to possible withdrawal after 2014.

Allstarecho is correct in what he says. There is no reference to male-male sexual relationships in the section: Personal relationships. Here is what it currently says, in it's entirety: 
James's personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark, with whom he fathered his children. Growing up, James did not have any parents, for his father, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was murdered and his mother, Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood, and he had no siblings.[103][104]
Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about James's sexuality. The word """"relationships"""" could mean anything, depending. I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean England's, as are concepts of male bonding, friendship, and what's acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods. However, there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates. Call it what you will, but excising that from the main article section is not fair. Don't use modern terms if that is the issue. Also, the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article, and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long. Footnote #24 is 117 words. I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it, including the assertion that it is murky, and debated.  Even if that section is shorter, as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about James's sexuality. Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion. That seems fair and balanced, something that I wish to work toward. But to excise mention of anything other than platonic/family relations from the main article is not. Sorry, but footnotes don't count. People just don't generally read them. ?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This user has vandalised various pages including Neil Young, Annie Besant, Cortez Trio, among others. He has made personal attacks against various users, including myself, and vandalised a series of talk pages. He has been warned multiple times by various users, but has ignored all warnings. I do not know who he is, but he seems to be out to get me (as seen by his posts above) and other users such as Johnleemk. I have been trying to avoid getting into an edit war, but vandalism is not acceptable on wikipedia so I revert it. I have never delt with such large scale vandalism before and am not sure how to handle it. Any help would be appreciated.   

The Cortez Trio is a Canadian jazz-folk trio composed of Justin Besant (piano), Peter Georgas (vocals/guitar), and Frank Grek (percussion). Based in Toronto, Canada, the Cortez Trio performs original compositions and covers at local hotspots such as """"Cafe Bleu"""". They are influenced by a variety of artists ranging from Keith Jarrett to Ian Tyson. Their name was inspired by the Neil Young song, Cortez the Killer, off of the album, Zuma.

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award has neither an article nor a template. It's in over a dozen articles so far. Create either if you feel it's meets WP:N.

 Kaballah and Tarot 

The article implies that Kaballah and Tarot weren't related until the 19th cent. occult movement. I assume that's a reference to the Golden Dawn. Or Papus. But that's more of an assumption than anything. The cards first appeared, albeit in a somewhat different format, at the same time and in the same place as a flowering of non-Jewish interest in Kaballah. 

I raise this here because 1) I'm not sure how to correct the article, 2) I'm a newbie and would rather not do harm in an attempt to do good, and 3) I'd like to see if anyone else has strong opinions.  

 
Tarot and Qaballah have a 1 to 1 correspondence, and are almost
certainly paralell descriptions of the same mythic archetypes.
The history presented here is propagandist christian; it assumes
that Tarot was started in Italy, which is patently culturacidal
because the cards are part of pagan European mysticism, and they
did all they could to kill off the pagans.
Italies versions were propagandist toy versions of the original,
copied without an understanding of the meanings and changed to suit
the assumptive interests of the new Italian art culture.

 """"1 to 1 correspondence"""" is one interpretation, but a poor one. Parallels between the Tarot and the Tree of Life have been drawn (Eliphas Levy?), but they do not parallel other components of the Qaballah, such as the texts on Gematria. While many neo-pagans have adopted and adapted the Tarot, I seriously doubt any kind of pagan origins (although I'd love to see evidence for such).  

 Could you offer any evidence for your statement of a Pagan predevelopment? The """"normal"""" knowledge about Tarot cards development in Italy lists various examples of really existing old playing cards called Trionfi and really existent documents which use this word Trionfi.  

 
yes, there is proof that the trionfi cards actually did exist.
No, there isn't proof that this is a verifiable point of origin.
Proof can be very hard to come by in a situation involving cultural
genocide, however, there are a variety of esoteric proofs and even easier to understand basic arguments.

The first of these is the simple question of sociology and anthropology. Okay, if Tarot is a product of Italian culture of that Time period, where out of that culture did those symbols derivate?
The answer is, they didn't and couldn't of, they were obviously
symbols from a system the Italians had no knowledge of.

 So YOU say, buddy. Can you please give us some proof that the Italians DIDN'T have any knowledge of tarot symbolism? And what symbolism! Empresses, chariots, the sun... the moon. A tower. All of it stuff with which Italians would have been completely and totally unfamiliar, huh?  Vince In Milan

Other """"proofs"""" as such hinge on increasingly more esoteric facts,
and, as weak an argument as the above sounds, if you know Tarot, it is a VERY sound argument as one starts to apply the basic principle
per card. The Tarot is OBVIOUSLY a wheel of the year mythic architecture, the Elementalist perspective would have been an anacronism in Italian culture of that time period.

new age noise, but another case of somebody who actually saw
the obvious;
http://www.psychicsahar.com/artman/publish/article_399.shtml

As a side note, Tarot suffered more than its sister system, the Tree
of life, which has also been revisionist histroied to start in the 13th century. Unlike Tarot, the proof of this is patently obvious to any who have studied esoteric judaism. The bibles symbols and images
are based on Qaballah, not the other way around. Everything is derivated in Judaism by virtue of the TREE, including even the hebrew
language. 

At the very least, we can show that the Trionfi is not the original Tarot by refering to the Tarot of the Bohemians.

I stand by my deletion on the skepticism page. I didn't delete the whole article by any means. I removed the part about false skepticism because it is unprovable and inhereintly doesn't go together. False being the opposite of truth, and skepticism believeing nothing to be certain. To be a false skeptic is impossible to prove and is not a view point but a chance for people to oppose halocaust deniers and such in a biased way on the wiki. I believe that most likely the halocause for example happened, but I am not going to say it is """"false skepticism"""" nor are the """"sources"""" any more reliable or proving anything. So you know how to report better, have better contacts, and tend to have a majority(or enough active members) to back your agenda. Then martyr me and get it over with. It is better to delete it since I legitamately believe it to be unsalvagable and completly opinionated to the point that is pushes a biased agenda. The whole point of the page is for the reader to decide what is skepticism and to go from their. Lets make this more of a history book and less of a language arts book. More of a tratise on the basics of known science rather than meta physics and quantum theory.

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member rib and both men glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

olice were at the church watching everything,?Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. hey even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.?

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with ed wax?immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, o Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,?the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were o followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,?and the ecrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.?

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

his is nonsense,?said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. e can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.?

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, e have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,?Sahyouni told Compass. e do not need to get permission.?

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

hy don the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches??the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other members. on they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.?

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. 

Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. 

ven if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,?the pastor told Compass. y the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, kay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.?

The first is that there is widespread criticism of Craig and his views to the extent that this is a part of his life, secondly that no only does it mean the article is incomplete, but it suggest an un-neutral POV.

 Renaissance Capital 

Hi, yesterday you made this edit at the Caesarstone article, removing a reference to Renaissance Capital that was there for verification purposes regarding information relating to Caesarstone's March IPO on the Nasdaq. Renaissance is often cited by the Naz's own online news reports, as well as by Reuters and other prominent outlets. The edit summary said """"WP:RS adsense spam,"""" but I'm uncertain as to what that means and how the reference qualifies as spam when it's there for the purpose of WP:V. I'll thank you to take a few moments to share the reasoning behind that edit with me, especially as my tendency is to revert it as a misidentification as spam of something that's intended as an innocent citation.?

No, im not Ashley Favel - i know someone who could very well be his younger brother, but he and I are quite separate people. After a quick glance across his page, I can see why you considered us to be the same people )

The society has had many a notable event prescribed to its name. For example, a student whom is now a astronaut with NASA was once a humble member - Andy Thomas that is. Several other events throughout time, such as the hanging of a car on the torrents footbridge, the disassembly and reassembly of a entire vehicle into a corridor of the third level of engineering south, the stealing and ransom of Ronald McDonald from the myer center - all were orchestrated by AUES members. The way I have explained them here makes such events seem only of interest to a quite narrow, local, audience, but when thought about, they are things which can be told in such a way that they are of interest to the greater population. Things such as the hot water system in the Crown and Anchor pub, in the city, being removed by students during one of the engie pub crawls would also be notable, in my opinion.

I could include communism there, together with buddhism and Jesus Christ, but I think you wouldn't be pleased either. You said you have a vast love for society. In that case, are you in favour of a universal public heath?

The article states that """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""", but this is not true. They are exlusive acording to the constitution of Montenegro, the constitutional charter of Serbia and Montenegro, and half a dozen separate censuses since the mid 20th century - all of which allow only one national identity to be declared. These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation). On the other hand, it is true that a number of Serbs and Montenegrins may believe that they have both identities - but there is no modern census nor constitutional basis that can support a statement such as """"Montenegrin and Serb identities are not exclusive"""". Many Montenegrins do not feel to be Serb, and never pronounce themselves as such. You can not force national groups to """"be Serb"""" if they do not feel so and never declare as such.

""""However the number of Montenegrins does seem to be in steep decline since the introduction of the category by the Communists on the 1948 census"""" seems to imply that the Communist regime declared the nationality of citizens in polls. This is not true, as citizens declared their nationaility in polls, individually. In fact, the Communists - for the first time allowed citizens to declare their nationality as Montenegrin - by introducing the category, which is more important. If it stands like the previous user wants it to stand, then we must add a sentence stipulating that the """"Serbian ruling dynasties in the pre World War II Yugoslavia banned Montenegrin citizens from declaring their nationality as 'Montenegrin'"""" This is as true as the Communist quirp, as the Montenegrin option was obviously not allowed before World War II.

The article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers, or is this based on the fact that you are a believer of the SOC?

The sentence """"The validity of the referendum was not confirmed by international observers as the allegedly free and democratic vote, in fact took place during wartime in the former Yugoslavia."""" is true. So I leave it. Of course, I agree to change """"international"""" into """"OSCE, EU and US"""" - as the referendum may have had international monitoring from Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, Byelorussia, and Russia.

 Tram and trolleybus articles 

Thanks for your comments.  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport, particularly in continental Europe, since the early 1980s, and that, of course, is the subject matter of the newly translated template (and the articles that are and will be linked to it).

Until recently, en.wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have.  Although I can't speak Italian, and can barely read it, translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator.  Since November last year, I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations.  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en.wiki, the it.wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step.

Since I started work on my latest project, I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de.wiki, so I will start translating some of the de.wiki articles soon.  In the meantime, I have just created one very long overdue en.wiki article, Trams in Milan (not fully translated as yet), and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days.

Which brings me to a query about nomenclature.  There's quite a bit of material on both it.wiki and de.wiki about individual classes of trams (and trolleybuses).  However, I'm not sure how translations of those articles should be named.  If an article is about a generic make and model (eg Siemens Desiro), then it can just be named as """"make model"""".  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).

It seems to me that there's a major deficiency in this article, which is that it's not made clear what the connection is between a rotation matrix and the geometric operation of rotation  this connection being that if you premultiply a rotation matrix by a column vector, then the result is another column vector that is just a rotation of the first.

Okay, it is stated eventually, but not until the geometry section, and there only in the abstract language of linear algebra, putting the main point of rotation matrices out of reach of anyone except those who should know it already.

I'm hesitating to jump in and revise it, as I'm kind of new to linear algebra, but will probably go ahead and take a crack at it eventually if no one with more expertise wants to step up.

Hello.  To Jeffro77 above...  The original and first reference that I put in was Thomas Cahill, and his book The Gifts of the Jews - How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels.   And I originally put that ref alone.  The Wilson ref came later on, from a search, and at the request of Jeppiz.   But Cahill alone I felt was overall sufficient at that point.  (And that Cahill book had literally zero to do with anything with Jehovah witnesses, or any JW books or journals or sermons.)    That wasn even on my mind in that sense, nor did I look at ANY Watchtower publications regarding this article or this specific matter.  Cahill had nothing to do with that.       And even Jeppiz admitted a number of times that it was a reliable source and ok.       But the Wilson source I provided here later on (and then soon on the article itself) was only at the demand of Jeppiz, for another source.   He kept insisting to find something else, etc, so I did a search, and the Wilson thing was even more pointed in a way, and it in a pro-JW website, trictly genteel? which transcribed the noted WT book s the Bible Really the Word of God?? and the link can be found here http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/wordofgod/wordofgod4.html.       (Also, to DougWeller, hello.   I still not sure why you say that I got the name of the book wrong.   That what stated as the source.    J.A. Wilson.   And he World History of the Jewish People?   At least that he main part of the name of the book, and I believe Wilson was a co-author of that or something.)    But, to Jeffro, you seem to think (incorrectly) that I probably had the Wilson ref as paramount, when in actuality that was just a side thing and accident, because of subsequent demands and circumstances on this Talk page.   Cahill was actually my guy on this specific matter on the Exodus matter, NOT Wilson necessarily nearly as much.      The exact (in-context) quote from Cahill book says this:   

hen we examine the considerable extant literatures of Mesopotamia and Egypt, we find no obvious mention of the Israelites.  If, as the majority of scholars have provisionally concluded, Israel escaped from Egypt in the reign of Rameses II about midway through the thirteenth century B.C., why is there no record of this marvellous defeat in any Egyptian text or inscription?   Of course, the defeat may have been so embarrassing to Egypt that, like many great powers, it could not allow itself to record honestly what happened.    Alternatively, the story of the drowning of Pharaoh army may have been inflated over time by Hebrew oral tradition, and what had been a minor skirmish in Egyptian eyes (we know, for instance, that Ramses II died not in a watery grave but in his bed) was eventually puffed up beyond all recognition.  Most radically:  the Exodus may never have taken place, but may be just a story concocted, like Gilgamesh, by nomadic herdsmen in need of an evening entertainment.    This last hypothesis, though temptingly unambiguous, can be maintained only by ignoring  undeniable aspects of the actual text of the Bible.    There are real differencesiterary differences, differences of tone and taste, but, far more important, differences of substance and approach to materialetween Gilgamesh and Exodus, and even between Gilgamesh and Genesis.""""

Cahill continues:   

""""The anonymous authors of Gilgamesh tell their story in the manner of a myth.  There is no attempt to convince us that anything in the story ever took place in historical time.   At every point, rather, we are reminded that the action is taking place nce upon a timen other words, in that pristine Golden Time outside of meaningless earthly time.   The story of Gilgamesh, like the gods themselves, belong to the realm of the stars.   It is meant as a model for the hearers, who believed, in any case, that everything important, everything archeteypal, happened, had happened, was happeningt is impossible to fix this occurrence clearly in one tense, since it occurs outside of timeeyond the earthly realm of unimportant instances.   For all the ancients (except the Israelites, the people who would become the Jews), time as we think of it was unreal; the Real was what was heavenly and archetypal.  For us, the heirs of the Jewish perception, the exact opposite is true:  earthly time is real time; Eternity, if we think of it at all, is the end of time (or simply an illusion).     The text of the Bible is full of clues that the authors are attempting to write history of some sort....But there is in these tales a kind of specificity concreteness of detail, a concern to get things righthat convinces us that the writer has no doubt that each of the main events he chronicles happened.?

Since the stated reason for this one-week block is wholly spurious, absolutely false, I demand to be unblocked immediately.

Not only did I never make any """"personal attack"""" against you, admins will observe that I actually thanked and praised you for intervening, which I also did in my private email message to you. This pretext for a one week block is absolutely spurious. You're making a minor disagreement on a tangential point on the Talk page into something personal and abusing your authority.

As for your comments on the Talk page:

 I never accused you of making ad hominem arguments, I asked you to calm down  WP:DISENGAGE.

I was never not """"cool"""" to begin with, so it's unnecessary to tell me to """"calm down"""", """"cool down"""", etc. Moreover, you said to me: """"I see some efforts being made to try to work out the differences, they will not be worked out if you resolve to not negotiate and dig in your heels. Respectful discussion free of attacks is the best way to do this ..."""" This implies I had made """"attacks"""" on people in lieu of trying to negotiate a solution reasonably. But like I said, and as you seem to now acknowledge, I never employed any ad hominem arguments (i.e., """"attacks""""). Moreover, any administrator can go to the Talk page and see for themselves that I've gone to extraordinary lengths to negotiate a reasonable solution with other editors.

 You can be right about something and still be wrong  META:DBAD.

I don't know what it is you think I am """"right about"""" but still """"wrong"""" about. But you seem to be implying I'm being a """"dick"""". I challenge you to present any quotes from me evidencing your implication that I've been a """"dick"""", i.e. by making """"personal attacks"""". You'll find you are unable to do so.

 You have engaged in a level of rhetoric that has created a hostile atmosphere (WP:CIVIL), you refuse to relent from your positions and you attack the positions of others with walls of text and barbs (WP:DBF). You've had editors ask you to calm down and you've had admins ask you to calm down and yet you've attacked anyone who has asked you to  WP:NOTTHEM.

Again, this is a false characterization. Every response of mine to others arguments has been to address the facts and logic of their arguments, as I am doing here with you. I have in no way been uncivil either with you or the other editors engaged on the Talk page. I have discussed diverging views and made numerous concessions to others on the Talk page in order to come to a consensus. My replies to others on their positions have consisted of substantive responses on points of fact and logic, never """"personal attacks"""" or """"barbs"""" (""""walls of text"""" might apply, as I've gone to extraordinary length to outline my own views and to support my own arguments with facts and logic).

Thanks for the correction. I'll reiterate: """"Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's not helpful. Cheers.""""

Incidentally, it is apparently this comment you here regard as a """"personal attack"""" against you. Any other admin can see for themselves I did not attack you here. On the contrary, I merely observed here that you had characterized ME as making """"attacks"""", when I had never done so. You're making this personal and abusing your authority.

 This is the first thing you posted immediately after your previous ban expired (WP:NAM) followed by open questioning of your ban even being valid, it appears you need more time to cool down, 7 days should do.

You have not substantively addressed even a single point in my argument why my previous ban was wrongful. Yet you block me further on an even more spurious pretext  this time an absolutely false allegation that I attacked you personally. Other admins can confirm I never once did so.

 If you come back from this block and engage in more vitriol here again I'll have no choice but to take further sanctions and ban you from editing or discussion on this article per WP:GS.

On your further mischaracterization of any of my remarks of mine as """"vitriol"""", see above.

I would request that whatever admin makes a decision on this that you please substantively address my points here.

355a0a2cb2039565,"If you read the Oohashi paper, you will see the trouble they have gone to, to source ultrasonic music from gamelans, special playback equipment, special tweeters, etc .... everything checked from source to speaker system. Meyer Moran does not even seek to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not pretend to be a test of ultrasonics. It does not claim to be a test of ultrasonics. If you wish to assert that Meyer Moran is a test of ultrasonics, you will have to formally prove that EACH AND EVERY ONE of the elements of the chain passes the ultrasonic test. So let's check it out

1. Source material:  

This is discusssed at:  
http://www.sa-cd.net/showthread.php?page=1
It turns out that the vast majority of source discs used by Meyer Moran were recorded in the 50s, 60, 70s or 80s ... they are CD quality masters, and therefore do not have ultrasonic content.  
Summary: SOURCE MATERIAL:   FAILS ultrasonic test

2. The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran has to be able to reproduce ultrasonics. 
The source equipment used by Meyer Moran is listed at:
http://www.bostonaudiosociety.org/explanation.htm
The principal equipment consisted of an Adcom GTP-450 preamp and Snell C/V speakers.

You can find the specs for the Adcom GTP-450 preamp here:

http://www.users.interport.net/a/d/adcom/gtp450.html

The specs are listed as: 20Hz to 20kHz.  FAILS ultrasonic test

The specs for the Snell C/V speakers are given here:

http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/1194snell/index3.html

They show massive drop-off above 22 kHz. FAIL

Summary:  The playback equipment used by Meyer Moran cannot reproduce ultrasonics properly.

GRAND SUMMARY:  Meyer Moran is not a test of ultrasonics. Meyer Moran do not claim it is a test of ultrasonics. The only person claiming that it is a test of ultrasonics is you, it is  your own original research, which is a violation of the Wiki original research provisions. Worse, your claim is  completely flawed and erroneous, at EVERY LEVEL of the chain, from source material through to speakers.

I'll leave this up for a day or so for some discussion. If you cannot prove your original claims, then ... out it goes.

P.S. Your Lehrman (2008) reference is just a quote of Meyer Moran - it also has absolutely nothing to do with hypersonic, or ultrasonics. You might want to take this to the CD advocacy page - but it has nothing to do with the ultrasonic effect. Out it goes. (  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Protestant revolt. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - The Reformation. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at The Reformation - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

As far as I can tell, learned people don't express their opinions as either """"Vatican II is infallible"""" or """"Vatican II is not infallible"""".  Everyone is pretty much agreed that ecumenical councils exercise their infallibility via the promulgation of dogmatic definitions, so the question really is whether Vatican II promulgated any dogmatic definitions.  Even the famous Pope Paul VI quote that traditional Catholics always cite uses this terminology:
here are those who ask what authority, what theological qualification, the Council intended to give to its teachings, knowing that it avoided issuing solemn dogmatic definitions backed by the Church's infallible teaching authority. The answer is known by those who remember the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964. In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary manner any dogmas carrying the mark of infallibility.?(General Audience, December 1, 1966, published in the L'Osservatore Romano 1/21/1966)

Well, one issue at a time:
The last sentence of the 1st paragraph truncates the narrative by jumps from one subject (internal policy) to another (foreign policy), before falling from the sky after decades to following paragraph without even suggest the reason of 1920s military revolts (not to mention that even remotely touches the civilian ones).
To remedy the last flaw of this paragraph, and with citations (easy to check) in English (other section's defect: too many sources in Portuguese, one of them is not even specific to Brazilian history) and
before to deal with the 2nd paragraph [ one issue at a time ) ], I suggest to let the 1st paragraph fine and end the discussion about this paragraph, 
I propose that the mention concerning to changes of Brazil's boundaries  in the early 20th century (even because, the border issue of Acre, in addition to not being the only one of that era, contained in itself a military phase, among others, having not been characterized or reduced to a mere purchase...), be placed at the beginning of the 3rd paragraph in the foreign affairs: 
 """"In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period,* was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations,* after its involvement in World War I.***"""" ; 
more or less eg as I had proposed, both with a neutral point of view and specific easily checking citations in english...

So, if you agree to it in relation to the 1st paragraph, I will talk about my suggestions of changes regarding the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs and (again) why of it...

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Rginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the linkhat's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Rginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

d5ef9dff36ac058f,"Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition.

f70158702dd58e11,"Reforming Wikipedia is an impossible feat, i fail to see positive improvement on articles. I find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much. The ability for growth is stifled. I have seen 99% of Maya books and articles use Ahau instead of Spanish Ajaw yet the editors of Wikipedia like to stand out as different. Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau. Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered. War exists even without religion because religion is NOT mere organized armies, religion is also mere individual political belief, or personal concepts of what is true, and it will rally people. It does right here, and in chats, and in bulletins. Woul not be caught by name on here, you all make me shame to be on.

1141d532b170240f,"I'm still awaiting an explanation as to why my careful and accurate sourcing of statements in this article was vandalized while I was away during the past three weeks.  When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.  For example, re the Brincknell incident, Alan deliberately conflates William Waters, one of the jurors in the coroner's inquest into the death of Thomas Brincknell, and Oxford's servant, William Walter.  On p. 48, Alan writes of the coroner's inquest that:

>The 17 jurymen were, however, as compliant as the jury was packed: one juryman, William Waters, was Oxford's own servant.<

Alan clearly knew this statement to be false since he himself transcribed the testimony of Oxford's servant, William Walter, in a 1599 lawsuit in which William Walter described himself as being 50 years of age on 8 May 1599.  See Alan's transcript at:

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/RUSWEL/ruswel07.html

Oxford's servant, William Walter, was thus almost the same age as the 17-year-old Oxford at the time of Thomas Brincknell's death, and could not possibly have served on a jury at that age.  The juryman William Waters was obviously an entirely different person from Oxford's servant, William Walter.  Because he did not like the jury's finding that the death was the result of Brincknell's own actions, Alan deliberately made a false statement about one of the jurors to impugn the jury's finding.  This is merely one among dozens of examples I could cite which demonstrate that no 'fact' stated in Alan's book can be accepted without checking it against archival documents.

 FC Bayern edits 

I removed Julian Green, Fabian Benko, Gianluca Gaudino and Ivan Lucic as they don't play for FC Bayern.  They play for FC Bayern II.  While they are on pro contracts, they are not part of the team.  They have been """"loanded"""" to FC Bayern II until further notice.  I noted this back when I added footnote 148 about the trio being demoted.  While they are permitted to be recalled, they are assigned to FC Bayern II.  That is where they show up on Wiki, rightfully so.  While on a pro contract, they are assigned to FC Bayern II and that is where they should remain.  This would be the same as showing Hojbjerg as part of FC Bayern.  Technically, he is part of the squad, but on loan to Schalke.  He is different in that he can't be recalled at moment's notice.  But the similarities is that he's assigned to Schalked, just like Green, Lucic, Benko and Gaudino are assigned to FCB II.

 Sorry, WilyD, but re-stating a flawed argument doesn't validate it. You're starting from the standpoint that the one true meaning of a word is the one used in a single place and, thus, all other different uses of the word are invalid. This is not true. Although movies and books have made """"American"""" an understood term for """"from the United States"""" in most countries """"American"""" is used for the landmass and not the country. In Latin America (which comprises far more people than the USA itself) the term """"Americano"""" is used for the landmass and the continents, not for a country. This may sit well because as you've implied """"America"""" has always been for you your country and while this is respectable it doesn't mean your opinion is more valid that the one from those that don't share it. Incidentally, stating that only your local opinion is valid is as much soapboxing as you're trying to lay on others. Unless the Wikipedia is suddenly defined to be formally U.S.A.-Centric (and being in english obviously doesn't count) then """"rest-of-the-world"""" views are perfectly acceptable. This page exists, in part, to make it clear that """"American"""" is not always a demonym of the USA and this is a fact. As much a fact as U.S. citizens believen it does.

Hello FlugKerl.  Congratulations on creating Richard VanGrunsven.  It is great article and well-sourced.  I have just done a little copy-editing.  The opening paragraph includes the following sentence: The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year in North America exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies.  Could you check the source cited for this sentence because I think the sentence contains an error?  It states that the number of Vans' aircraft """"produced each year in North America exceeds ... """" and compares it with """"all commercial general aviation companies.""""  Vans' aircraft are manufactured in large numbers by amateur builders all around the world, not just in the USA and Canada, so the large number of such aircraft produced annually shouldn't be confined to North America.  Secondly, if you are talking about """"all commercial general aviation companies"""" you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:
The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America.

An editor from the GOEC has edited the article and reduced the expanded lead down, some of which has since been restored. The 3 main editors are unhappy with the changes made to the lead and the removal of sub-sectioning in the History section. Thanks.

UNBLOCK: 1. The reason I used sockpuppets was to avoid harassment from user: Dibo who immediately reverted all my edits, ,  and  when I forgot to log and branded me a sockpuppet of some previous user, here  which the checkuser proved did not exist . I got into a revert war with user: Tancred and user: Dibo who from the contributions, seemed to devote their time exclusively to making trouble and aiding each other in edit wars, as is shown here, ,  as well as in the earlier case regarding user: Ehinger222 who they erroneeouslly accused me of being. After several days of edit warring with user: Tancred over the right to call rugby league football, football,(surely a neccessity and not erroneous), user: Tancred's vandalism to the rugby league nations template here , The names of various sports on the Marconi stadium site  and whether the a-league franchises should be referred to as clubs(part of their franchise names, e.g.Queensland Roar FC is a franchise and not a club, but takes the name of a club for marketting reasons) or franchises, and whether minor premiers were premiers or not. Tancred has a history of edit wars, exemplified no better than here. I was banned by user: Chuq although my last free edits from here were this , , my last was this .  is where I made an argument for my case for the A-League case. Earlier, I had asked Chuq to please get a non soccer admin to help sort it out made in language not too different to chuq's .

I felt I was hard done by and resolved to annoy the blockers as much as they had annoyed me before resuming as my previous identity and making a large number of useful contributions before being bogged down by a piece of shit like user:Dibo who provoked this whole encounter. User:Dibo and User:tancred are the ones who should be banned if any justice is to be done, and I am resolved upon annoying the whole lot of you unless I am unblocked and the usefullness of my <500 edits is acknowledged as actual contributions and user:dibo recognised as the edit warrer that he/she/ it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I don think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word onsensus?it doesn matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.
God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

I interpret silence as no contention, and have moved the item here:
It is not easier to balance an egg on its end on the first day of spring. In fact, the ease or difficulty of balancing an egg is the same throughout the year. This myth is said to originate with the egg of Li Chun, an ancient Chinese folk belief that it is easier to balance an egg on Li Chun, the first day of spring in the Chinese calendar. In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun. It was introduced to the western world in a Life article in 1945, and popularized once again by self-titled """"urban shaman"""" Donna Henes, who has hosted an annual egg-balancing ceremony in New York City since the mid-1970s.

The RfC I was referring to was the informal one on the article talk page; I notice no one has responded to it but we have all chosen the threaded discussion instead. I'm all for an outside discussion, but I'm thinking you may not approve of the Denialism category itself, which is a whole 'nuther argument. Have you checked it out to see what's in it? 
I think you may have missed what we are saying is being deniedevolution. We are not saying that to believe in God is denialism or that God is a fairy tale. I believe in God (Elohim, Jehovah, El Shaddai). We're saying that denying evolution is denialism of the accepted scientific theory. You wrote, """"While some editors have argued that this refers to ID's alleged denial of evolution. . ."""" Why """"alleged""""? I quoted Behe to you from the DI's website: """"Darwinism is false."""" That is patent denial of evolution. 
I agree with Cla88's post of 00:57, 28 February 2012. The first paragraph of the lede is deeply flawed, and probably the tone of the whole article is dismissive editorializing rather than objective presentation of the concept. I haven't read the whole thing at one sitting for a long time, so I'm not sure of that. The first paragraph is very confusing on the identity of the designer, which should not even be brought up there. (ID proponents, though, are themselves two-faced about this point.) This subject is very contentious and I despair of ever seeing a fully objective article. When I'm in Wiki-land, I do as the Wikipedians doadhere to the 5 pillars.
Also, I hope you've caught on that the specific variety of intelligent design of which this particular article treats is the ID of the Discovery Institute and its affiliates and sympathizers. (Can't think of a better word than sympathizerfollower, maybe; those who agree with and may promote the idea without actually being affiliated. The community church on the corner, for example.)

 Article Licensing 

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain, you could replace """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" with """"{{MultiLicensePD}}"""".  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I would like to know that too.  Please let me know what you think at my talk page.  It's important to know either way so no one keeps asking.    (comment| talk)

 Well, I'll give you my opinion. I wrote the Intervals section, and I admit that I didn't write it well at all. It was one of my first Wiki contribs, and it sucked quite honestly. I would encourage someone to re-write it if they want to, or I will when I have time to mull it over and do it properly. However, as far as the specific point over whether it relates to the article: harmony cannot exist without intervals. When two distinct (by which I mean different) pitches are sounded, the interval between them is what creates harmony. Harmony and interval relationships are inseparable, because they're one and the same. So absolutely, a section explaining intervals is relevant. However, the way in which I went about explaining it in my contrib wasn't so great. Again, I would encourage a competent and learned musician to do a re-write, or wait and I'll do it.  

 I will say one other thing, which is that Wikipedia is a learning reference, and will serve its best use to the public if Average Joe can come along and glean complete information from non-confusing articles. My ideal is this: say a churchgoing person, one who has very limited musical knowledge, wants to learn how to sing the alto/tenor/bass/whatever line in hymns, so that he/she can feel more """"one with God"""" on Sunday mornings. I want for that person to be able to look at this article, and come away with a clear idea of how harmonies work, so that he/she can practice singing them. The oneand onlything which creates the alto, tenor, and bass lines are the fact that they're pitched at an interval to the melody (soprano) line. Again, intervals and harmonies are one and the same. For the large percentage of the population who struggles with learning things """"by ear"""", a comfortably firm understanding of interval relationships is (along with practice thereafter) the magic key to unlocking the ability to """"hear"""" (discern) harmonies. That's why I think it's important to keep the section in question, but to rewrite it.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one patriotism under control? That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

Look, the Purdue chapter does not exist as a current organization it has been dead since the 1930's. Through June of this year, some person or persons with some sort of senseless Purdue agenda ran through wikipedia creating several fraudlent articles which had to be removed and posting a storm of argumentative rants in the process. (Some of this material is preserved in the history of this article.)

Even the above comments, regarding T.N.E. history, is untrue. Purdue was never an Alpha chapter and the misrepresentations of early summer proved that. No chapter of any kind was ever """"sanctioned by Yale"""", and no chapter could be """"sanctioned by Yale"""", since Theta Nu Epsilon was never directed by anyone at Yale, nor was Theta Nu Epsilon even a Yale society at that time.

This is an encyclopediac article, or at least it should be. As such, it should contain all significantly relevant information, and it should prioritize the information someone would want to find most easily.
Kaiser's logo is relevant to anyone who wants to know about Kaiser, it seems Wikipedia considers the identity of the CEO of an organization relevant, and their website seems almost required - if someone, for instance, came to Wikipedia in order to find the website, they should be able to do so moderately easily; Kaiser's website should, in an article about Kaiser, stand out from all other links in some way.

Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

In addition to that Jordan signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt.""""

 that section right there. The """"As a result of such dramatic situation ..."""" you make it sound like it was because of Israel the mutual defence agreement was signed. Even in King Hussein's own book and through historical records its pretty clear jordan went to war not because of a threat of israel winning, but a threat that egypt and syria would win sidelining jordan big time.

At any rate i think it would be better not to context why the wars started etc. Focus on battles, etc. Most of the israeli incursions were also due to Israels concept of if Palestinian guerrillas attack to hit back at the arab militaries instead.

I disagree, as this article has had a history of people trying to add irrelevant material to it (such as the costs for proper supervision). If you review Wikipedia:Article titles it says (emphasis added is my own): """": Article titles should be recognizable to readers, unambiguous, and consistent with usage in reliable English-language sources."""" Also """"The ideal title for an article will also satisfy the other criteria outlined above; ambiguous or inaccurate names for the article subject, as determined by reliable sources, are often avoided even though they may be more common. For example, tsunami is preferred over the arguably more common, but less accurate tidal wave.""""

 I'm going to be bringing in additional experts to assist with the article 

Due to controversy and repeatedly being bogged down by genocide deniers who conspire against any dissonance and manipulate and exploit Wikipedia policy in order to get away with their genocide denial, I am going to bring in several experts who will assist in exposing the truth, and embarrassing those who committed and support the rape of children.  I know at least three people who I am sure will accept my request; I also plan to invite more to come and assist with rewriting this article.

 Paul Siebert 

This guy's just like a Holocaust denier in the way he masks his revisionism in casual and practical editing.  He recently removed the section by Sascha and commented that it was poorly sourced despite the fact that two of the sources are easily availible online, and another is from a book, which can also be found on Google Books if the page or quote is entered.  He's clearly grasping at straws.

Would anyone have any objections to sending out a mass text to undo his revisionism when he goes on one of his rampages?

  
He was correct. """"Poorly sourced"""" means that the added text was not supported by any sources mentioned in the article. If you want to add something with proper references, go right ahead. And in the future, please refrain from accusing a good editor of something as serious as """"Holocaust denier"""" when you know for a fact this is not true. I highly suggest not attempting some kind of attack on the article either. |  | talk | 

I was the original writer of the section.  I also received the same briefing on Paul Siebert from Alex before registering here.  First, the sources were mentioned in the article, if you're referring to the ones about Neo-Nazi historical revisionism, as I was talking about what Neo-Nazis say, and their revisionism.  Second, Paul Siebert, assuming what Alex told me is true, is a Holocaust denier, as he denied acts of genocide committed against Holocaust victims at the end of the war.  This can be confirmed in Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State and The Fall of Berlin 1945, both of which have been cited here by Alex.

 Response to Skinwalker's personal attack on  via a RFC  

Hi

This is a response to 's RFC on .

Rather than straight talking language, some folk prefer to use clever legalistic attacks on individuals such as the way that  is using on .

In the context of the Wiki, this is an ad hominem where his intellectual powers failed to persuade the consensus on the discussion page.

 failed to get his way with regard to muddying of the waters with anorexia just as   had done previously with the met industry's pollution. So what happened her is they conspired to attack  with the use of a meatpuppet called   employing all the trick they can like making false allegation, lying, official complaints and so on.

I would like to point out that in British English the word nark is non-pejorative and I understand that it has an objective meaning something akin to a """" snitch """" in American. That is, meaning someone that makes, often erroneous, allegations to authorities in order to personally benefit themselves in some way. It is certianly a lot less intentionally insulting than to be continuously called a meatpuppet or, I am sure, for user Canaen to be accused of having some connection with me when he has none.

The funniest thing for me is that  is busy digging a hole in his own canoe because his allegations are outright lies of which he can in no way substantiate.

This conflict started because  insisted on posting data refering to anorexics on the Vegan topic which had no relationship to veganism whatsoever.

 is entirely wrong. I know this because I know who I am and I know with whom I have and have had connections and I take a very minor little offence at being accused by the likes of you of being something I am not. I state """" very minor little offence """" because you and your views genuinely are so unimportant. 

  is an individual of very little decency and integrity. I do not state this as an insult but as an objective statement.   has been told on many occasions that I have no connection with this or the other individuals and yet he not only continue to go on making such allegations but   even uses them as the ground to make an attack on another individual.
 

This is where   boasts to Canaen he has made a complaint about him on Canaen user page ;

User conduct RFC

Please be advised that I have filed a user conduct RFC on you.  It can be found  here.  Cheers,  

This is where I - as one of the erroneiously accused """" meatpuppets """" respond ;

Just out of interest, who do you think this nark  is and why is he so motivated to go about doing what he is doing? I put this record up in the open for you and them to see because I have no and have had no connection with you nor any of the journal pages and, frankly, I take offence at being called a meat or sockpuppet of yours when I am not. I am sure that you are just or even more upset as being accused of a connection with me when you have none.

Unfortunately though, that is the depth of 's lies and the shallowness of 's integrity. 

 Where he has no grounds he invents them and he is, oh, so clever at playing WikiTricks with all these technical terms and methods. 

I am starting to feel like a Jew in Nazi Germany being hunted down, connected to individuals which I have no connection with and their so-called crimes and accused of crimes which are not mine. 

And what of ? He just seems to get off on throwing around his weight whilst avoiding entering into the actually factual discussion.

For the record - and let them love every minute of their persecution syndrome, let them avidly copy and paste and make little weblinks to this as they are so good at Wikitricks - I am a vegan of 20 years or more standing and, arguably, MacDonald of Clanranald. I became involved in editing the vegan article before you returned to it recently.

Good day to you, sir. It seems a shame that you have taken this attitude, after all, I did welcome you nicely in the hope that you might want to contribute constructively to this encyclopedia. Wikipedia isn't a spoof website, it's an encyclopedia, so articles that you think are amusing are not nessesarily seen as funny by others. It wasn't actually me that deleted it, I merely flagged it up as being non-encyclopedic and another editor thought the same. Westenders is a nice idea for a parody soap opera, and that sort of thing might be seen as quite comical on a website such as Uncyclopedia, which is as spoof encyclopedia, thus if you want to write less serious entries that may be the place to go. However, if you do wish to contribute seriously, please don't let this setback stop you - perhaps our paths will cross again in a positive context.

Well, I must of course sympathise with you to some extent, but really, I must far more urgently recommend that you hesitate to rely on lexicographers for cogent definitions of technical terms. Just today I had occasion to consult the internet facility of a very major dictionary, concerning """"parasitoid"""", a matter of which I have a modest understanding. Their definition was biologically illiterate. I agree that the OED text on """"Heat"""", to which you refer, might read more comfortably to the layman than our flowing (or non-flowing, as you prefer) stuff that we have been talking about, but really, OED or no OED, that text cannot possibly be acceptable in our WP article if we don't want to be a laughing stock, perhaps even a reproach and a byword, among our informed readership. It just won't do. Certainly you have a point in that what we have is heavy going to the innocent and with due deference to another author who eschews """"chattiness"""", colloquiality, and comprehensibility, I insist that we should include at least introductory material that the intelligent layman can understand, but not by presenting inaccuracies for him to understand.

Hi,
Your page is the ONLY reference I have found for removing the left sidebar.  Really excited about this.

Found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PleaseStand/Hide_Vector_sidebar

Can you expand on the install instructions?  I did not add it to 'User:myname/vector.js', but instead 'User:myname/common.js'.  This didn't exist before I created it.

Also why have the vector skin check at the end if it is added to the skin javascript directly?  I just realized I added it to global first, and the check did work.  Moving it over to vector.js now...

I fumbled through but expanded instructions may help others.

Also, the shortcut key does not work to un-hide on Macs.  Not that I want to unhide it...
I could not figure out what to edit in the code to change the shortcut keys.

It also loads after all of the page content, is there a way to load it before so the sidebar doesn't appear then disappear, or edit the skin directly?

Fyunclick vs. Outside Sources

Wikipedia is an """"encyclopedia"""" and as such, should reflect outside sources, not one's own POV. Not only that, Wikipolicy calls for PLURALISM which requires the articles to reflect major points of view, not just one. However, in this case probably the majority, if not a plurality, of sources reflect my POV. For example:

http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/history?type=men

When ESPN lists the winners of Grand slams, they don't worry about issues such as Open era/pre-Open era, challenge round, or pre-1925 French. Not only that, but research has shown that the French was actually MORE open to outside competition than the US Open and Wimbledon were in their early stages. 20:15, 5""",0,0,0,0,0,0

But if the reader sees that """"RT's aggregation says this"""" and """"MC's aggregation says this"""" and reads a sampling of critics' quotes beneath that, then a reader can make up his or her own mind.

All right, I may have to concede defeat here. Personally, I see the case as crystal clear, but it's the opinions of RSs that count, not my own. FTR, my textbook is The Historical Jesus by Theissen and Merz, 1996. They cite Dalman, Klausner, Maier, and Thoma. Individual scholars are bound to disagree, but does anyone have a disinterested secondary or tertiary source that describes the dispute at second hand? WP:WEIGHT says that when there are sources on opposite sides of an issue we look for second-hand descriptions of the dispute. And personally, if you think that Yeshu isn't Jesus, could someone name any historical figure that matches """"Yeshu"""" better? I would really change my mind if someone could explain who Yeshu is if not Jesus. He's s sorcerer named Yeshu (later identified as the Nazarene) who has disciples and who is executed around Passover? Who is that if not Jesus? If that's now how the Talmud portrays Jesus, how does the Talmud portray him?  (talk)

Acroterion, I don't believe I need to review or post what a broad cross-section of scholars have to say on the subject.  I believe a 5th or 6th grader could determine the relevance of the facts I propose to post.  

Plus, you are imposing an impossible standard in that most scholars don't state the obvious for obvious reasons.  Why should an accomplished scholar say 1 + 1 = 2 when everyone in his or her audience already knows the answer?  

Here's a reasoned conclusion a 5th or 6th grader could arrive at: Since Fisher's affiliation with the National Lawyers' Guild was already public knowledge, McCarthy didn't do anything wrong by mentioning Fisher was affiliated with the National Lawyers' Guild at the Army hearings. And Welch was wrong to denounce McCarthy for saying that.  I'm not proposing to say that, but the conclusions are inescapable for even a 10-year old.

I do not doubt your good faith, but your analysis and reason appear weak.  No one besides you has raised that objection.

Are there others that join you in raising that objection, because I'm not convinced anyone besides you believes that?

BTW, this appeared on the Army-McCarthy hearings site:  """"At the time Brownell was seeking to designate the NLG as a Communist front organization, and McCarthy mentioning Fisher's membership violated a pre-hearing agreement to not raise the issue as it was still being litigated.""""

Looking through the archives here, it seems that discussion of the article's name has almost entirely revolved around a suggested move to """"British India"""".  Clearly such a move would be outright wrong.  But that still leaves us with the problem that while """"British Raj"""" does seem to get usage as a name for the territories under the authority of the Governor-General in Council, it's also used as the name for a period (see the article lede at """"History of the British Raj"""" by way of example).  In other words, the term is ambiguous, and thus we keep having people here and elsewhere changing terms back and forth, and I don't see how that will change so long as that ambiguity remains.  That's why I think """"Indian Empire"""" is better; it's clearly about a country.  Alternatively, and I say this through slightly gritted teeth, we could have it at """"British Indian Empire"""".

As for usage by historians, surely they most commonly use the simple term """"India""""?  Which is not of course to say that other terms don't get used (especially in book titles).

It is not common (because almost every defendant in murder cases opts for a fast-track trial) but it may happen.

A fast-track trial is a trial where no actual trial is involved. I'll try to explain it. A criminal proceeding in Italy consists of many phases:
1. preliminary investigations;
2. preliminary hearing;
3. trial;
4. appeals.

After the preliminary hearing, the Judge only decides whether or not the evidence gathered so far is enough to sustain a case in Court. If so, he sends the defendant before the Judge of the Trial, where he will be convicted or acquitted; if not, the Judge sort of acquits the defendant.

A defendant can, though, choose to give up his right to a trial. He will be, then, tried by the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing, who will hand down a judgement, based upon the evidence gathered so far.

Since this is a reduction of the defendant's rights, it must be he who asks for a fast-track trial. In exchange for that, he is compensated with a lighter sentence. If there are two or more defendants, one may opt for a fast-track trial and the other choose to stick to the standard pattern. In this case, since it would be unfair (or so Italians think) to let the wishes of one of them take precedence over those of the other, the two defendants are tried separately, even though they committed the same crime.   14:05, 11",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've said it below earlier that he wasn't considered very famous in many parts in the world. So a citation is needed for the rock history thing. Because it's vague when you say just rock history, it would be fitting for Yoshiki to be the an influential drummer (maybe most, but that might need a citation as well) in rock history in Asia.  

So, when we say that Bonham is one of the most influentials drummers in the rock history, we have to say that his one of the most influentials drummers in UK and not in the rock history? =/, yeah, Yoshiki is the mots influential drummer of Asia, but Asia is also inside the rock history don't forget this ;)

 Only Japan? 

Somebody has just put that Yoshiki is one of the most influential drummers in Japan rock history, eehm, everybody knows that Yoshiki is THE drummer of Japan, and because of that is one of the most influentials in all rock history, not only in the rock history of Japan, if you see bands in China, Korea, et.c you'll see that their drummers are fans of Yoshiki.

Well, I guess not just Japan but in Asia. The reason to why I put that is because while Yoshiki is well-known in parts of Asia, he wasn't as influential in many countries like the Americas, Africa, and Europe. Sure, there are people in those continents that like him (and X-Japan as a whole), but it's not enough compared to the majority who hasn't heard of him or X.

The wording of the most recent edit is needs tweaking. Reading the source provided, Hunter wrote in opposition of a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces, an unreliable Afghan Leadership, concerns regarding roadside bombs, and what he saw as """"Obama administration's other shortcomings"""" which he termed """"mixed messages"""" to American service members and the world. And as stated by the Administration in 2012, there are were no plans for a complete withdraw; which had changed as recently as recently as this month to possible withdrawal after 2014.

Westside
You recently deleted my article on Westside, because it was not """"verifiable"""". You said that I needed to have Westside reviewed by newspapers, or something along those lines.

How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought """"What better than Wikipedia?"""" Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside?

Allstarecho is correct in what he says. There is no reference to male-male sexual relationships in the section: Personal relationships. Here is what it currently says, in it's entirety: 
James's personal relationships included relationships with his male courtiers and his marriage to Anne of Denmark, with whom he fathered his children. Growing up, James did not have any parents, for his father, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was murdered and his mother, Mary I of Scotland was forced to flee when she married the suspected murderer, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. His grandfather was assassinated during his boyhood, and he had no siblings.[103][104]
Someone reading the article as it is now would have no idea that there is any debate about James's sexuality. The word """"relationships"""" could mean anything, depending. I also agree with Carcharoth that the current concepts of gay and homosexual are quite different from Jacobean England's, as are concepts of male bonding, friendship, and what's acceptable in society across most cultures and time periods. However, there are reliable sources that say James had sexual relationships with at least some of his male associates. Call it what you will, but excising that from the main article section is not fair. Don't use modern terms if that is the issue. Also, the section should be in rough proportion to the other summary sections in this article, and several of them are approx 230 to 330 words long. Footnote #24 is 117 words. I would agree to move the footnote up to that section and integrate it, including the assertion that it is murky, and debated.  Even if that section is shorter, as long as it gives readers the idea that there is debate about James's sexuality. Then work on the daughter article per the suggestion. That seems fair and balanced, something that I wish to work toward. But to excise mention of anything other than platonic/family relations from the main article is not. Sorry, but footnotes don't count. People just don't generally read them. ?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I usually read all of a discussion and think about it, before replying to any of it.

We have yet to have any sources that show that Brian Harvey is an expert, or what fields he is an expert in.  It's rare for an instructor at a University to be tenured, and also rare for senior faculty to let them make policy decisions alone, without tenured senior faculty's input and approval.  Instructors are usually hired to implement policy set by senior faculty, and kept on if they do the specified job well. This frees up faculty for other tasks and projects.  But this is mute - see the next point. (But if you feel you have to, in Brian Harvey's case, sources please to show otherwise.)   

Brian Harvey is not what Wikipedia refers to as an Independent Source (aka third party source).  He has used Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SCIP) at Berkeley and has been acknowledged by Abelson and Sussman in the Second Edition of SCIP. (He is not acknowledged in the First edition. (Took me a little while to find a hardcopy.)) So using him as a reference is a small step from using Hal Abelson, the subject of this biography. Wikipedia asks that non-Independent Sources be used with care and only when an Independent Source can not be found. 
 
The Boston Globe reference has the same issue in their feature, and should not be used as we have an Independent Source.   

Chris Haynes and Dan Friedman are acknowledged in the Second Edition of SCIP.  Mitch Wand is acknowledged in the First Edition of SCIP.  So their book has the non-Independent Source problem.   

Which leaves us one source that  found. I'm not going to try and find out if it's an Independent Source, i.e. who was in the group that decided on giving Abelson the award.   

Without a reference, this sentence with the word """"worldwide"""" in it fails WP:NPOV. It is also unclear what it means: how many CS departments?, what parts of the world?, etc. Even with a reference, the claim should be in a quote from that reference, not in plain text. Wikipedia prose is suppose to be written in a neutral tone, with non-neutral text clearly tied to a source. WP:NPOV also requires that available WP:SOURCES (if any) that balance out the article on this and other parts of the text be added. If you know of one on this point or others, please add it to this biography.   

A claim this wide could have other Independent Sources making it.  If any one wants to find and add them ...   

The laundry list of course materials is trivia that isn't needed in a biography, and is distracting to the reader.   

So ....   

Proposed consensus

I propose we change the sentence to this:

The Association for Computing Machinery notes this course """"was widely emulated and adopted by colleges around the world.""""

and add this as a new paragraph, perhaps in a new section Awards:In 2011, Abelson received the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award.  The citation read """"For his contribution to computing education, through his innovative advances in curricula designed for students pursuing different kinds of computing expertise, and for his leadership in the movement for open educational resources.''

If this award was published in an ACM journal, it be better to use the  template.

 Kaballah and Tarot 

The article implies that Kaballah and Tarot weren't related until the 19th cent. occult movement. I assume that's a reference to the Golden Dawn. Or Papus. But that's more of an assumption than anything. The cards first appeared, albeit in a somewhat different format, at the same time and in the same place as a flowering of non-Jewish interest in Kaballah. 

I raise this here because 1) I'm not sure how to correct the article, 2) I'm a newbie and would rather not do harm in an attempt to do good, and 3) I'd like to see if anyone else has strong opinions.  

 
Tarot and Qaballah have a 1 to 1 correspondence, and are almost
certainly paralell descriptions of the same mythic archetypes.
The history presented here is propagandist christian; it assumes
that Tarot was started in Italy, which is patently culturacidal
because the cards are part of pagan European mysticism, and they
did all they could to kill off the pagans.
Italies versions were propagandist toy versions of the original,
copied without an understanding of the meanings and changed to suit
the assumptive interests of the new Italian art culture.

 """"1 to 1 correspondence"""" is one interpretation, but a poor one. Parallels between the Tarot and the Tree of Life have been drawn (Eliphas Levy?), but they do not parallel other components of the Qaballah, such as the texts on Gematria. While many neo-pagans have adopted and adapted the Tarot, I seriously doubt any kind of pagan origins (although I'd love to see evidence for such).  

 Could you offer any evidence for your statement of a Pagan predevelopment? The """"normal"""" knowledge about Tarot cards development in Italy lists various examples of really existing old playing cards called Trionfi and really existent documents which use this word Trionfi.  

 
yes, there is proof that the trionfi cards actually did exist.
No, there isn't proof that this is a verifiable point of origin.
Proof can be very hard to come by in a situation involving cultural
genocide, however, there are a variety of esoteric proofs and even easier to understand basic arguments.

The first of these is the simple question of sociology and anthropology. Okay, if Tarot is a product of Italian culture of that Time period, where out of that culture did those symbols derivate?
The answer is, they didn't and couldn't of, they were obviously
symbols from a system the Italians had no knowledge of.

 So YOU say, buddy. Can you please give us some proof that the Italians DIDN'T have any knowledge of tarot symbolism? And what symbolism! Empresses, chariots, the sun... the moon. A tower. All of it stuff with which Italians would have been completely and totally unfamiliar, huh?  Vince In Milan

Other """"proofs"""" as such hinge on increasingly more esoteric facts,
and, as weak an argument as the above sounds, if you know Tarot, it is a VERY sound argument as one starts to apply the basic principle
per card. The Tarot is OBVIOUSLY a wheel of the year mythic architecture, the Elementalist perspective would have been an anacronism in Italian culture of that time period.

new age noise, but another case of somebody who actually saw
the obvious;
http://www.psychicsahar.com/artman/publish/article_399.shtml

As a side note, Tarot suffered more than its sister system, the Tree
of life, which has also been revisionist histroied to start in the 13th century. Unlike Tarot, the proof of this is patently obvious to any who have studied esoteric judaism. The bibles symbols and images
are based on Qaballah, not the other way around. Everything is derivated in Judaism by virtue of the TREE, including even the hebrew
language. 

At the very least, we can show that the Trionfi is not the original Tarot by refering to the Tarot of the Bohemians.

I stand by my deletion on the skepticism page. I didn't delete the whole article by any means. I removed the part about false skepticism because it is unprovable and inhereintly doesn't go together. False being the opposite of truth, and skepticism believeing nothing to be certain. To be a false skeptic is impossible to prove and is not a view point but a chance for people to oppose halocaust deniers and such in a biased way on the wiki. I believe that most likely the halocause for example happened, but I am not going to say it is """"false skepticism"""" nor are the """"sources"""" any more reliable or proving anything. So you know how to report better, have better contacts, and tend to have a majority(or enough active members) to back your agenda. Then martyr me and get it over with. It is better to delete it since I legitamately believe it to be unsalvagable and completly opinionated to the point that is pushes a biased agenda. The whole point of the page is for the reader to decide what is skepticism and to go from their. Lets make this more of a history book and less of a language arts book. More of a tratise on the basics of known science rather than meta physics and quantum theory.

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member rib and both men glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

olice were at the church watching everything,?Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. hey even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.?

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with ed wax?immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, o Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,?the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were o followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,?and the ecrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.?

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

his is nonsense,?said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. e can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.?

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, e have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,?Sahyouni told Compass. e do not need to get permission.?

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

hy don the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches??the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other members. on they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.?

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. 

Abou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. 

ven if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,?the pastor told Compass. y the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, kay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.?

Hello,

Your article on the Hydrospace was proposed for deletion today. I got rid of that, but you might want to consider writing in a more formal tone. Also some kinds of information are banned on Wikipedia including
 contact info
 current retail prices
 personal judgments or opinions

Although you did nothing wrong, many people here will reflexively erase/revert your entire contributions rather than edit your work. Taking a look at the wikipedia:Manual of Style might save some frustration later.

Generally speaking,  is correct in that there should really be a criticism section on this page, for two reasons. The first is that there is widespread criticism of Craig and his views to the extent that this is a part of his life, secondly that no only does it mean the article is incomplete, but it suggest an un-neutral POV. I am unsure why  did not pursue this, someone needs to. DocHeuh

I know you're keep to defend Vibhijain from what you see as unreasonable opposes, but your persistence may be interpreted by some as badgering, which could ultimately damage this RfA's chances of success. I would council against continuing to respond to the opposes (or any other section) and just let them have their say. If they step out of line, you can rest assured other editors will challenge them.
