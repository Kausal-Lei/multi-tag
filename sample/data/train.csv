31896f3942a724ad,"The first quote is imprecise, as it allows the implication that her demeanour was part of the reason for her arrest. The second quote grammatically excludes this implication. Also, the use of wiki voice to imply certainty regarding the reason for her arrest is inappropriate. I don't know why your not seeing that. Your third quote removes the unintended implication, but retains the unwarranted and somewhat offensive authoritative tone regarding the reason for her arrest. It is also significantly longer and doesn't read as well. It's barely if at all an improvement on the first quote (though it removes the grammatical shortcomings) and far worse than the second quote, which I still don't see any problem with.",0,0,0,0,0,0

RE:Accusation of fake warning
I won't revert your move of removing my warning, as it's up to you what you keep or remove on your talk page, but just to get things straight here, that was not a """"fake warning"""" as you put in your edit summary when you removed it. You were definitely removing sourced information w/o sufficient reasoning. (You said """"hard to define"""" was not encyclopedic, but you removed far more, including reliable sources, than just that phrase.) Furthermore, you did it repeatedly, and refused to discuss it on the discussion page. 

Again, you're free to remove what you want from your own talk page, but don't lie about the reason at the expense of other users. Thanks.  msg me  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your links at Fatal Frame 

I saw your request for help at Help talk:Page history and came here to see what the problem was.

The Wikipedia rules on external links are much stricter than many editors realise. In particular, most links to blog sites are not allowed. The automated program  has been taught to check all edits made by new users which add links. One of its rules is that if the site name contains the word """"blogspot"""" then the edit should be rejected. 99% of the time this works well, helping new users to learn the rules.
Once you had been warned by XLinkbot, it was not helpful for you to continue trying to add the link. This can eventually be seen as disruptive; hence the warning that included the word """"vandalism"""". The term is used at Wikipedia to include various types of disruptive behaviour, as described here.

Let's move forwards! I think your best bet would be to post to the article talk page, Talk:Fatal Frame, asking whether the link is an appropriate one for the article.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0
f0e2008756b05da2,I am not currently an employee of Loblaws but I did hear that when a local Your Independent Grocer store (which are owned by Loblaws) was closed that full-time staff who had worked there for many years were offered a job at the new Real Canadian Superstore at a starting wage of $7 or $8. It would actually be quite impossible for all those employees to find jobs at other Loblaws stores as they are now being phased out and replaced with RCS stores. Another store in Kanata was just closed and replaced with an RCS store.,0,0,0,0,0,0
