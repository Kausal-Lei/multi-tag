 Your links at Fatal Frame 

I saw your request for help at Help talk:Page history and came here to see what the problem was.

The Wikipedia rules on external links are much stricter than many editors realise. In particular, most links to blog sites are not allowed. The automated program  has been taught to check all edits made by new users which add links. One of its rules is that if the site name contains the word """"blogspot"""" then the edit should be rejected. 99% of the time this works well, helping new users to learn the rules.
Once you had been warned by XLinkbot, it was not helpful for you to continue trying to add the link. This can eventually be seen as disruptive; hence the warning that included the word """"vandalism"""". The term is used at Wikipedia to include various types of disruptive behaviour, as described here.

Let's move forwards! I think your best bet would be to post to the article talk page, Talk:Fatal Frame, asking whether the link is an appropriate one for the article.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

2. Early Conservation Work (sub heading under career) This is my section for the project. 

From the section on his life as a trapper, we will discuss the impact of Anahareo on his switch from trapper to Conservationist.  
The transformation of his own personal views of conservationism will be explored through his writings in Pilgrims of the wild.
His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book The Men of the Last Frontier?which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

Source matter in this subheading will discuss Grey Owls beginning with Parks Board Canada through meeting James Harkin, covering material surrounding the films he made with their support, and his placement as caretaker of park animals at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.  
His relationship with W. J. Oliver regarding his being commissioned by Parks Board Canada to make films of Grey Owl will also be explored.  
We will also delve further into his later life as a conservationist and his role in Prince Albert National park.

[edit]Conservationist Views (new heading)
His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loos States of Nature?Conserving Canadas Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smiths From the Land of Shadows,?and Grey Owls Pilgrims of the Wild?as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.

4. Conservation Legacy (sub heading under Posthumous recognition)
The inspiration his lectures, books and films had on the people who came into contact with them will be explored deeper by using the sources below, as this is an area of his life which is largely overshadowed by the controversy of his false indigenous identity.

Right. So we've dealt with the question of Qworty's slander. Let's move on. Here's why you should not be involved in this discussion, Qworty.

Others have reinstated my close twice now, which I'm perfectly fine with.  I'm more than willing to defend the close if need be.  The MFD was the fourth forum where the discussion had been brought.  In NONE of those forums was there anything near a consensus that Cla should delete the advert.  The issue failed to gain actionable traction on ANI nor on Jimbo's page.  And future discussions were unlikely to garner consensus.  Thus an RfC was opened.  Once the RfC was opened, which is calling for a wider community input, then the RfC should have run.  The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.  This MfD's action is not an indicator of how well watched MfD is, but rather how controversial the debate is elsewhere.  Opening it was a clear case of ForumShopping and it should have been closed immediately as such.  If I read the comments and thought a consensus might be reached one way or another, I wouldn't have closed it.  But it is clear that no consensus exists and that the proper venue is the RfC where wider input can be obtained.-'''' Poppa Balloon'' """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Though I've made mistakes as a Wikipedia newcomer, I am not oblivious to the attempts by some to make a mountain out of a molehill in this short a time I've been a member of Wikipedia. As an example, I was recently blocked without knowledge of this being done, and with no proof as to the reason but citing """"edit warring"""" which I did not partake in. Moreover, the more I cite sources that are verifiable, and the more I read, and apply Jimbo Wales Wikipedia principles & guidelines, the more trouble newcomers seem to get into with what appears to be a clique of POVers, and """"revert warriors"""" who take the honest mistakes of newcomers, and turn them into immediate accusations, use of pronfanity, and the """"one-way"""" pastes of comments from me onto RFC & arbitration pages - taken out of context, without adding their OWN comments on edit summaries, and talk pages. I find this curious - since, to prove that a person is doing such a thing as they say - revert warring - and being """"disruptive"""" in honest writign & editing, and citing sources, and references, that some such as Ruud, Bunchofgrapes, and others, would find it useful not to add their own comments which, if arbitration members can find them - contain a hostile tone, reject attempts to work together, are mean, avoid sourcing themselves, with their own entries very much POV while """"revert warring"""" without first reading, or seeing the sources cited. This has happened many times with me in just over one month and I just got here. Some on the RFC page who signed have even resorted to deleting their comments to fit their accusatory assertions on Theodore7 - but pasting my comments as one-liners - and sentences as """"proof"""" of my being disruptive? If this is the case, then why do they not add their own comments, and my return comments in context? Doing this - cutting, and pasting my words OUT of context to then fit into their accusations - is what is going on, and this only makes more suspect their own Wikipedia edits; which, are very weakly sourced (if at all) despite my doing so, and asking others to do so in accordance with Wikipedia principles, and the advice of some Wikipedia administrators who were kind enough to help me without biting a newcomer - nor making immediate accusations designed to disrupt themselves. For instance, Bunchofgrapes made several """"reverts"""" on materials I added sources to - and then turned to make rude comments on edit summaries. I asked him to please not do this. It seems more common to not cite sources and to """"revert war"""" - a term I did not know existed before joining Wikipedia. It seems that many of the crew who complain so much about the newbie Theodore7 have been """"revert warring"""" for some time. I just stumbled onto some rather neferious POVing, and """"reverters"""" who throw out that claim onto others if they do not agree with something that is counter to their own point of view. This is why citing verifiable sources is important. However, some just seem to think Jimbo Wales' principles do not apply to them. I think different. I am new here, and I read, and am applying more of Wales' principles and guidelines as I go along - despite some who would laugh at this, and, if one is good enough to read through all the """"complaints"""" about Theodore7 - other would mock Wales' principles & guidelines, and tell newcomers not to """"use"""" him as a excuse, etc. This is the kind of thing that has been going on since I recently joined Wikipedia.

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit. If you continue to undo the improvement of source citations that I am doing, the you and I are going to have a big problem. -",0,0,0,0,0,0,

Personally, I do not see any reason to reference the IQ of John Morgan in the article.

Moreover, Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons states """"We must get the article right.[1] Be very firm about high quality references, particularly about details of personal lives.

 1 = France
 2 = Germany
 3 = England

 My name Is Martin Charles Fran莽ois B茅langer... Family Archive bearer... 

I am a direct descendant of the B茅langer Family knights that came to Canada From the family castle in France. The """" Chevaliers De Belle Angers """" I.E. (knights of beautiful angels), from the """"Chateau D'Anger"""" next to the town of """"Anger"""" in Normandie of France. Our Ancestors are recorded to have been """"Gaulois"""" since 300 years before Christ... meaning Gaelic... and YES, Gaelic France is the same as in England... and it is the origin language of French... (RECORDED FACT OF HISTORY).

 The Familly from Germany that is related to the Belanger Family and not B茅langer

family, was actually the ancient family of Ingers. This Family also had many dealings, commerce and mixing of families between the B茅langer and Belanger family. This produces Belle Ingers... Belingers, Berengers, and more... Ingers also had a great meaning to the name and you may want to look it up. (Proven to be found in the original family archives.)

 The B茅langer Family also went to Nottingham England in the service of the King to help in the holly Crusades. The name then was pronounced Belanger, and made quite the mix in the family tree. (Found in the original family archives.)

  There is quite the extensive research done in exactly what happened in our family.  For more information on the real origins of the real B茅langer Family... Look for...

The """" Chateau d'Anger """" in Normandie, France... and look into the

Family of """" Ingers """" in Germany. Both families pre-date the roman invasion of Europe.

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?

 Your revert 

Hello.

I would like to kindly request reconsideration of your revert (see link above). I had reinstated an edit removed based on a misunderstanding of a previous editor. The other IP user had replaced somebody else's comment with his own, and, when I attempted to take care of it, somebody had already reverted the edit, resulting in the old comment being restored and the new comment, which the IP editor posted (and removed the other comment in the process) being removed. Please browse the diffs starting from here. In my opinion, the edit was made in good faith. I restored the comment. The editor appeared to be legitimately inquiring about a deletion or revert. I reposted and signed it. I had noticed that you have reverted my edit. Please note that I have not at all made my edit in bad faith, and that I have never made bad faith edits to Wikipedia. I have been editing since 2008, had an account, but do not use it anymore since I am quite retired. I had a clean record and had never been blocked from editing. I do not know if it is possible to have those entries removed from the block log, since blocks count against an editor's reputation and I have not made any bad faith edits.

Please let me know if you have any further questions regarding this incident. Thanks in advance. 69.155.128.40  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

 Wrong Focus 

I'm new here, but it seems to me that this page, as it now reads, IS about IHD/CAD, to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease.  While it may be true that the term """"is usually used to refer to those [diseases] related to atherosclerosis (arterial disease),"""" I would suggest that this is careless usage, to which this page need not subscribe. So how should the article be structured? I'd say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model, with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section, with links in the relevant anatomic regions.  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation. Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology,diagnosis, and therapy would also be germane. Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page, I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease.

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article.

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0,0,0,0,0,0,

Please read the relevant guideline, which is WP:EL.  Basically, there is no way to add that link.  We are not a linking site.  The only way that link could possibly appear would be if Dedalo were itself notable enough for an article.  This would only be if Dedalo had been discussed, several times, significantly, in reliable, independent sources.  So, if there are news articles or trade journals that discuss Dedalo (please note that press releases don't count), then we could consider making an article on Dedalo. If Dedalo does not rise to that level of importance, then it's somewhat possible that there could be a discussion of """"software used for ICH"""" in the ICH article.  You should discuss that with other editor's on that articles talk page.  You'll still need at least one reference in a reliable source to include the info, and you will not be able to add a direct link to the Dedalo website.

Born in Riverside, California at just 15 years old his journey began. It was Rich's deep rooted love and passion for music evolving from a family of musicians, which really allowed him to turn his life around. This turnaround was despite all the trials and tribulations of his youth, while residing in Moreno Valley, California.

 Once in Seattle, Washington Rich embraced hip hop and rap music as well as the culture. Rich realized thru listening to the lyrics of others that he could really relate to what these rappers were saying. That is when Rich knew he too could share all that history he had bottled up inside thru his own lyrics. This is when hip hop really took over his life. Rich's level of musical development exploded, so he then channeled all his energy into writing and producing his own music. Rich is a producer and creator of addictive melodies, with beat wizardry that captures his audiences?attention.They become mesmerized by his verbal versatility with stories, outlining and defining his truly most turbulent times.

 In 2003, Rich established a Washington, D.C. Metropolitan based Management, Production and Promotions Company called; HardHead Records. This brings us back to where Rich is today, HardHead Records has now commenced an exceptional business network with key associates in the music industry. Since its inception, Rich has gravitated towards some daunting, precarious projects highlighting the true and reliable nature of the company.

 In a time of everyone just being out therefor themselves competition; HardHead Records remains committed to sponsoring and promoting local up in coming artists that are committed to something more than that. Artists of the DMV(Dc, Maryland & Virginia) that share a desire for unity amongst other artists. Rich has a vision of his trademark being something above and beyond the rest!

 Rich is currently working to create a movement in the DMV, a dynasty of sorts?evolving from the very best of the best. HardHead Records takes pride in preserving Rich's initial vision, which resonates his own virtues and beliefs. Rich stronglybelieves that in working together, in being unified and remaining true to himself and all those that choose to join the movement that unity will prevail.This prevalence of unity will in fact produce victory for all those that havewisely chosen to be involved.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

How do you not understand that you're confirming that the Babylonian empire ended in 539 when its king was called to account?!!  
Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus?first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or the seventh month (Tishri)?as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalems destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.   

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

I would like to strongly advise against deletion of this article on the argument that phylogenetics is not equal to, nor even synonymous to, cladistics. The difference between them is actually abyssal. Phylogenetics is a scientific discipline resting on the fundamental principle of objectivity, whereas cladistics instead is the opposite, resting on the principle of subjectivity. Phylogenetics partitions reality into categories (i.e. concepts) and discusses reality in terms of these categories, whereas cladistics instead assumes that categories (concepts) exist and confuses them. What phylogenetics discerns does cladistics confuse. In line with this approach, cladistics also strives hard to confuse itself (as a concept) with (the concept) phylogenetics and with (the concept) science. My empirical support for these allegations is that cladistics confuses time and space, thereby denying that time can be relative to space, which is contradicted by the fact that time is relative to space (see Envall, Biol. J. Linn. Soc. 94:217-220). Cladistics """"denies"""" the kind of thing it calls paraphyletic groups, which actually is a disguised denial of the fundament for science, that is, objectivity.

Deletion of this article would thus be devastating for phylogenetics, and in continuation, for encyclopedias (which tries to keep concepts apart) and maybe also for science itself. Instead, the article ought to be cleaned from cladistic influence. There is still a big part of phylogenetics that is (practically) free from cladistic influence, i.e., that which develops probability inferences of phylogeny, and still does the consistent conceptualization of phylogenies, that is, the Linnean system, occupy a central position in phylogenetics. 

A clensing of the article does, however, appear impossible in an open forum like this, since nothing can hinder cladists from incorporating their confusion in the article, whereas they can hinder a resolution of the confusion. The power over the content in articles is in practice related to number of proponents of certain comprehensions, rather than to knowledge about them or understanding of them. One can easily envision how Wikipedia would have appeared if it had been made of Germans during the 2:nd World War. Nazism would certainly not have been described in condescending terms. This is a fundamental problem for Wikipedia that needs to be addressed for Wikipedia to retain reliability. A basic requirement ought to be that its editors have at least some (scientific) education. There has to be some Captain(s) on the ship, and they have to have some (scientific) education. Otherwise, Wikipedia will gradually disintegrate into a mess.

If Wikipedia finds no other phylogeneticist that can (and wants to) clean up the article, I am prepared to do it. It does, however, require that I am given the power to include and exclude contributions to the best of my judgement and knowledge. My neutrality has been questioned in connection with my earlier contributions to Wikipedia, but as I have tried to explain, I consider a scientific approach (i.e., objectivity) to be neutral. The problem with cladistics is that it is subjective and """"denies"""" objectivity, since it leaves no neutral position between it and objectivity. There is no neutral position between a denial of a comprehension and that comprehension. I instead counter the """"denial"""" by falsifying it with empirical evidence. This does not """"counter-deny"""" cladistics, but only shows that cladistics does not agree with facts, whereas objectivity (i.e., science) does. I thus show that cladistics' """"denial"""" of science does not agree with facts. This conclusion is not neutral, but it is as neutral (or objective) as anything possibly can be. Questioning of this view on neutrality has to require an explanation of what else neutrality possibly can be. For me, neutrality is equal to objectivity. (Some claim that objectivity is impossible, but I claim that it is not. This is, however, another story).

I thus advise against a deletion of the article and announce myself as willing to clean the article from cladistic influence (on the condition that I'm given certain authorities). Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  )

Therefore the inclusion of the """"#"""" is for the social media mechanism rather than to represent the word """"number"""".

For example, did any editor have sexual relationship with a porn star or purchase movies or magazines of a porn star whose bio is listed on wikipedia?   This is a conflict of interest.   Another example, does any administrator, editor or volunteer of Wikinews and Wikipedia including BlackPearl14"""", SVTCobra?

Then BlackPearl14"""", SVTCobra?and Whoville?and all of these editors and administrators are in conflict of interest.  Does the people involved with the wikinews articles about fossilized fish found in Canada, or with scientific discoveries or with lawsuits, have any connection to these products, places or businesses?  Then this is a conflict of interest.  What kind of verification did Wikinews and Wikipedia use to determine that volunteers including BlackPearl14"""", SVTCobra?and Whoville?dont sell Disney products and have no business with the Walt Disney Company and their affiliates?    As documented volunteers including BlackPearl14"""", SVTCobra?and Whoville?together claim conflict of interest?and delete any contribution in regards to Pirates of the Caribbean for either wikinews or wikipedia, and control it by upholding double standards.  Thus first we must verify wikinews / wikipedia enforcement of their policy of conflict of interest?and neutral?

Wikipedia and Wikinews editors don't follow Wikinews' own written polices... Do you know of an issue that has been forgotten?? Then you generate and justify reason after reason to state that the above article is not newsworthy, and that wiki does not write old news. You even say one thing, and then later change that to be different claims to justify deletion.   You keep throwing different claims at an article you have targeted because someone had shown the charges to be untrue.   Wikinews and Wikipedia continues to uphold double standards, and then make statements with which to justify it.  Incredible, you ignore any details provided to your counter your claims, and then accuse the person of not acknowledging your control and your new set of claims.  Are you aware that Wikinews editors and wikipedia are in conflict of interest as well?   They proven that they have a network of supporting friends, using double standards, without following Wikinews and wikipedia's own written polices, and such.

Wikinews and wikipedia allows editors fans?to be bias, controlling whatever they choose to write even placing things like porn stars penis size, (copies of that have been documented as well) and to write articles that are one sided, promotional and links to various sites that further promote their cause, yet the editors delete anything that is added that they dont approve from other people, and then justify reason after reason, such as claiming other people as being a conflict of interest, not being neutral and such if they write or contribute.  It's against wikinews and wikipedia policies to simple delete """"when in doubt don't delete"""" and not to show respect when communicating.  Yet you simply deleted the entire talk and all related pages and justify various statements calling it whatever you want to get your friends to sign off on your control.  If you dont abide by wikinews and wikipedias own written policies, then remove all of the polices and stop telling the public to follow standards which are double standards and more..  Does the owner of the company know you are doing stuff like this?

Big changes: There are NO links to other articles in this article. The interconnected nature of Wikipedia is its strength this needs to be changed! Your style of writing is too conversational for an informational article. Write as if you are the expert. 

Little changes: Using Wiki markup to force a table of contents at the beginning could add structure to this article. This might help you better relate a topic to the next topic you're going to discuss. I would also suggest moving the image up to the top of the article, so you can immediately communicate visually with the reader.

Style suggestions: It needs some spell check; read it out loud to catch them if your word processor didn't. It could also use some grammatical editing to avoid embarrassing apostrophes dropping in wherever they like. 

Visual suggestions: The figure is well-made (that is, it gets across the process of producing a river anticline) but it is not properly tagged according to wiki's copyright protocols and it could stand some labeling and uploading in a higher resolution.

Overall, you have a good start. Adding links to other articles and presenting the most professional article you can will help you get the rest of the way there. Cheers!",0,0,0,0,0,0,

Drosopigiotes (Greek: 慰慰畏纬喂蔚) represent a population of Greek immigrants who were past inhabitants of the village Drosopigi, Florina in Greece. At present, the city of Rochester has the largest concentration of immigrants and families that trace their roots to the historically significant village Drosopigi.

Reply: I added another, different, quotation from the same article that helps firm up how Russell felt on the subject. I  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation; it makes it more conclusive. 

My statement that Russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a Modus Tollens argument. However, rather than speculating about what Russell did or did not suggest, my statement should have read that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. 

Modus Tollens would have us accept that had Russell, as president of the Watchtower organization, organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers. Since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among Russells fellow worshippers then the Modus Tollens argument form has us conclude that Russell never organized it. The underlying premises of this particular argument are 1) that Russell applied his presidency and that 2) his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives. There is ample evidence that Russell applied his presidency, and that his fellows acted on it. Hence, it is not my opinion that Russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers. Rather, it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises. 

For the time being I have removed the statement about Russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency. If you dispute the validity of what I write above then please offer logical refutation, keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes (i.e., private opinion). I make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions I may presently hold.

 Reason? 

Was there any reason that you removed several links to album reviews?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out. 

I'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined. Instead of editing pages for the sake of contributing, you've designated yourself as the be-all end-all """"link remover""""  where """"link remover"""" means """"person who removes others' valid contributions to bolster his own self-importance.""""

And if you even bother using """"promotion"""" as a reason that VacantLips' contributions to the reviews lists were """"spam,"""" then I'll have to ask you to remove all of the external links from the """"Reviews"""" sections on all album pages... Unless you have detailed accounts proving that the users who posted the external links weren't simply promoting their own websites. 

I'll expect that you revert your changes, once you realize you had no basis for removing the links in the first place.

Research on Italian Somalians

I appreciate your improvements,Middayexpress. I have done some research on books about the Italian Somalians and I hope you can find what you need. 

About the catholicism in Somalia, here it is the exact words in the Tripodi book:""""Il vescovo di Mogadiscio, don Franco Filippini, dichiarava nel 1940 che vi erano circa 40.000 Somali cattolici, frutto del lavoro missionario specialmente nelle aree agricole del Giuba e dell'Uebi Scebeli"""" (my translation: the Bishop of Mogadischu, Franco Filippini, stated in 1940 that there were nearly 40,000 native Somalians of catholic faith, consequence of the missions mainly in the agricultural areas of the rivers Juba and Schebelle). If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.

I have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta. (my translation: the italian ambassador believed that the wide practice of concubinage during the colonial years had created the problem that nearly 50,000 Somalians had at least one grandfather or a greatgrandfather Italian during the nineties).

About Yaron Matras (Madaares)' edits

Yaron Matras, non-Romani Professor in Linguistics at the University of Manchester, with the username  keeps adding the mention that the 岣om -> Rom theory is the mainstream, an obvious personal POV. Yes, it has anteriority as compared to Rajput -> Rom theory, but is certainly no mainstream. It was based simply on the assumption of a name similarity and a supposed similar low status. The fact is that these two assumptions were mostly based on the anti-Romani stereotypes and prejudices. There are plenty of possibilities of making connections between the word Rom and words from the Subcontinent  and also the peculiarities of the Romanipen do not suggest at all a low caste origin. Plus, the name Domba itself in the Subcontinent do not designate a specific ethnic group, it is just an exonyom given by the hight caste to some unrelated groups that have their own ethnic names. On these grounds this theory is dismissed as unscientific. And if it finds supporters mostly among non-Roma, as fitting their ideas about Roma, this does not mean it is mainstream. The other theory is obviously well represented worldwide.

I did not have previous encounters with Yaron Maras, but I see that this first one does not look at all as a positive one. I am not a member of any """"Romani Union of Romania"""" and I don't know of the existence of any such union. It is sad that he resorts to such cheap intimidations, probably fitting himself the image of those non-Romani researchers who """"seem to feel threatened by Romanies who are educated or who are branded as activists,?as though this were automatically a bad thing"""" as presented by Ian Hacock at Romani Origins and Romani Identity: A Reassessment of the Arguments. Is this a new proof that the Romani studies done by some non-Romanies are some of the last contemporary studies made in a colonialistic style?  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

What is not known is if it has linkage to Sabino, and sabino may be caused by a number of different genes, of which only SB1 has been mapped:  """"So far, it is not known whether dominant white (W) and sabino spotting (S) share a common genetic background. In this study, a pedigree consisting of 87 horses segregating for dominant white (W) was used to genetically localize the horse (W)-locus.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0,0,0,0,0,0,

In any case, I think that it is redundant for aircraft articles to state a measure that is merely the ratio of two other measures already stated.

 Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and still more """"Critique of the Universe"""" 

This goes to the whole question of the exclusive use of a single model of the universe that depends on the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. The consensus interpretation of theLambda/cold dark matter model must clearly be flawed if it leads to the conclusion that the scientific method must be scrapped in order to save the model (ref). Dark Matter and Dark Energy are ad hoc """"add-ons"""" that are trying to find theoretical justification. Dark Enegy, in particular, is being called a supernatural or """"unfalsifiable"""" hypothesis because no experiment can possibly directly challenge it (ref), justlike the existence of God hypothesis.

Heretofore, all hypotheses must adhere to the scientific method (ref), """"the SM"""". Now, in order to admit Dark Energy, cosmologists insist thatSM must be tinkered with and an unfalsifiable hypothesis allowed for the first time in history. If we do this, the Pope canre-ascend to the Throne.

All of the indirect """"overwhelming evidence"""" for expansion rate acceleration and Dark Energy can be just as well applied to the concept that our inventory of matter and energy in our local universe is inadequate and that the mass of the global universe is at least 22.2 times as large as has been supposed (100%/4.5% = 22.2). The total mass of the universe has been and still is open to question. The Matter/Energy that we can inventory accounts for only 4.5% of the total needed to """"flatten"""" the anisotropy pattern that is seen in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation or """"CMB"""" (ref). This proposedrevision in the """"total mass"""" and the General Relativity (GR)concept of the black hole hyperbolic field will savenot only SM, but the Friedmann Equations and the FLRW metric themselves too!

The """"inflaton particle"""" from which the universe may have sprung was the mother of all black-holes (MOAB). As such, it must have possessed an hyperbolic gravitational field that existed timelessly according to Alan Guth's quantum principles (ref).During the instant of inception of the differentiated universe that we can now detect, this hyperbolic field must have begun to degenerate. Space with time came into existenceduring this instant. The implication here of the prior existence of a sort of meta-universe is not explicitly acknowledged in any of the scenarios we read, but it is nonetheless an unstated assumption.

This space-time bubble's surfacetraveled up the MOAB'shyperbolic field gradient at a velocityhundreds or thousands of times the speed of light. This is Allan Guth's """"Inflation"""". Matter/Light could keep pace with the inflation of space-time only as long as its temperature wasseveral exponential decadesof degrees Kelvin. As soon as Matter/Light began tocondense and the fundamental forces began to differentiate, the inflation era ended (ref).The collapse of the infinite density hyperbolic field began. This hyperbolic field has been collapsing by means of a time-dependent processever since. It is this ongoing transition froma hyperbolic black hole gravitational field to a parabolic Newtonian gravitational fieldunderlying the global universe that is being mistaken for acceleration and Dark Energy (ref).

This is not speculation. This is not my personal idea. This is butone example of a differentlogical meaning of Allan Guth's inflation theory (ref)and General Relativity according to Schwartzchild (ref) and many others. When guided by correct meta-logic,mathematical physicists will be able to validate this or some othertheoretical interpretation of GR, the Friedmann equations and the FLRW metric. Then,with the demise of Dark Energy and Dark Matter, the scientific method will be saved (ref).

 Current Speculation 

There has been discussion lately about the appropriateness of this section. I will be going out-of-town for the next 5 days, but in my absence I highly encourage the frequent editors of this section to realize the need (and act upon it) to permanently remove this section. Its existence violates:

  NPOV (nuetral point of view)

- No one can truly say how or even if the listed items will affect voters

Types of bias include:

Ethnic or racial bias, including racism, nationalism and regionalism. 
Corporate bias, including advertising, coverage of political campaigns in such a way as to favor corporate interests, and the reporting of issues to favor the interests of the owners of the news media. 
Class bias, including bias favoring one social class and bias ignoring social or class divisions. 
Political bias, including bias in favor of or against a particular political party or candidate. 
Religious bias, including bias in which one religious viewpoint is given preference over others. 
Sensationalism, which is bias in favor of the exceptional over the ordinary. This includes the practice whereby exceptional news may be overemphasized, distorted or fabricated to boost commercial ratings. 
Geographical bias which may for example describe a dispute as it is conducted in one country without knowing that the dispute is framed differently elsewhere. 

The presence of this section is biased on several of the basses listed above

Wikipedia articles are not:

Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a """"sympathetic point of view"""" for every article.

The ethnic Macedonians only have one autonym - Macedonian. They don't want to piss off the Greeks. The use of the term to refer to themselves and their language is not an attack on Greeks. If it were, they would use the autonym """"Greek"""" not """"Macedonian"""". And """"Aegean Macedonia"""" is not necessarily an irredentist term. It can be used as such, but it is also used just to refer to Macedonia, Greece. You use the term """"Greek Macedonia"""" which is considered offensive by ethnic Macedonians because it suggests that that area is Hellenic, as opposed to only being under the control/jurisdiction of the Greek government. And then comes the dispute about whether Macedonia, Greece is Hellenic or not. 

Either way, if you don't want to be labelled nationalist or don't want to offend either side, I propose we use the terms """"Red team"""" and """"Blue team"""" to refer to the two groups of Macedonians - based on the  two flags using the Vergina sun. Alex 202.10.89.28  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

 My reply that you have deleted in a fascist manner from the Nicosia Discussion page....l 

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city麓s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

 Carbon-Carbon 

Perhaps that could use a little more explanation, then. Carbon brakes  are carbon on carbon, in that the material is used as both brake pad and disc. However, the material used is a carbon-carbon composite: carbon fibres set in a carbon matrix (see Reinforced carbon-carbon for more technical stuff). It could actually be either reason I suppose, but they are normally referred to as 'carbon-carbon'. The topic is discussed in greater detail further down the article - I've put a '(see below)' at the first appearance of 'carbon-carbon' which links to the 'Technical innovation' section further down.

Thanks for all the further edits - I've only reverted one (sorry! -)). The direct quote from Michael Scarlett about the MRD/merde connection shouldn't be corrected (ellipsis is acceptable), even if wrong grammatically, since that's what he wrote. Unless I've misquoted of course, which I'll check when I can get my hands on the article.

One question - I don't understand why in """"He also became the first man to win a Formula One race in a car bearing his own name..."""" 'race' is now in italics. 'Race' as opposed to what?

Also - are you sure about removing non-breaking spaces for units? My recollection is that they are recommended.

Thanks again for spending so much time going through the article  - it really helps to have someone else go through. I'm rather to close to spot some of the errors, or to act as a reader fresh to the topic. Cheers.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

 re: VfD bot assistant 
When you get to the actual closing process, I'm not sure I know what could be safely automated.  So many of the decisions require multiple steps.  But I may not be the right person to ask.  I tend to close only the oldest and therefore the most complex discussions.  I suspect that I see all the exceptions and lose sight of the commonalities among the majority of """"simple"""" decisions.  I'll give it some thought, though.  

Am I correct in assuming that the bot would have to be run for each individual discussion thread?  If so, what parameters would have to be fed in?  How complex would it be to initiate the bot?  Would it be a different bot for """"keep"""" decisions vs """"delete"""" decisions?

The essential steps for a """"keep"""" decision are:
 Close the discussion page ({{subst:vt}} and {{subst:vb}} - I suppose the top subst could be modified to allow for a parameter like {{subst:vt|reason}})
# Remove the VfD header from the page (which ''usually'' follows the naming convention of the VfD discussion page except for second nominations and related nominations discussed together
# Add a boilerplate comment to the article's Talk page with a link to the discussion.  I usually put the nomination date on the Talk page, but the closure date is probably close enough.

If the VfD discussion has the same name as the article, a simple """"keep"""" decision might be automatable with a single parameter.  """"Keep as merge"""", """"transwiki"""", etc. would still require extra steps.

The essential steps for a """"delete"""" decision are:
# Check the article's history to confirm that the deletion decision is in order
# Close the discussion page (as above but the reason is often much more detailed)
# Sometimes, check """"what links here"""" and move or delete all those links
# Delete the page

I'm not sure I see how to automate that process.  There are too many variables.  I'll keep chewing on it, though.  Thanks again.  ~~~~""",0,0,0,0,0,0,

The infamous block

Veritas: do not get Wikinoid yet. The policy is on my side: it was a totally unjust block and I am appealing. I still trust Wikipedia. I don't trust so much certain wikipedians and administrators but I have faith that in the end truth, justice and NPOV shall prevail. If not in the ANI, where admins seem to behave like a wolfpack, at least in first instance, in ArbCom. Policy is very clear and Shell Kinney simply broke all rules. 

In my appeal I also ask for Shell to be recused from further cases against me or related to the controversial article due to bias and misuse of admin privileges. 

I won't go back to that article at least in a looooong while. I've reached my personal limit with it and after all non-existent races are not my primary interest. I believe though that all this conflict will help to raise awareness about what is going on in that battlefield... (oops! article) and specially about Thulean's wikilawyerist attitude. Besides it may also raise awareness about misuse of policy by certain admins that never admit any error nor fulfill their duties. 

Ironically Shell Kinney is running for ArbCom herself. Guess that her campaign is something like """"Wikipedia needs an iron man and that's me"""" of Thatcher. I don't know. I'm voting a more promising candidate.

Bigfoot

Welcome back. Like the Devil and Daniel Webster. True, the intro is a mess and it must be made clear that Bigfoot is not a proven zoological species, but is tentative, and unproven. But the search goes on for evidence. The extreme LENGTH of this search leads researchers, with or without PhDs, to speculate that there may be a""""Plan C"""" where the beings may be neither hoax, (too many sighitngs for that) nor zoological (no body) but instead may be a theoretical space-time creature. This has not yet been stated. It needs to be. Skeptical editors can relax and know that skeptics are correct, there is no zoological Bigfoot nor Yeti. But there is something else. This is being ignored and swept under the rug. Always remember that with no official funding, """"mainstream"""" science has no positive opinion on the topic, and the work goes on by unpaid PhDs and many amateurs, and one paid non-academic.

Now, we, the Six, on the BF Edit Committee in Berkeley, will edit and re edit, and revert 
until the end of time to get the true and correct word out to readers. We will NOT
go away. Editors would be well-advised to work with our suggestions, since we know the literature and most editors never cracked a book. They, except one or two, do not kow squat on the topic, and most are lost in the theoretical quagmire. Most, it seems, 
are also uneducated. Daniel, welcome back.

Have you heard of evenko's law? One hundred and fifty years, or more, of """"serious"""" history and good old Dan's dog is the first to pick this tree. 
From what I understood of it, and it's rather over my head, Mc Carthy has a point. However, it would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater to adopt his dates before anyone else does. It means that every date in a book needs to be Mc Carthy-ised. 
And even then I have very serious doubts about the accuracy of the results. Mc Carthy's method may give accurate AD dates, but I suspect there are problems. Take 763. He's content to put Domnall Midi's death in that year, just as the historians are, but why does AD 763 start with an event dated to 20 November? Fair enough, that could just be a glitch from the compilation, but it could also be that whatever the source was, its years did not start on 1 January or March 25 but instead on 1 September. Adding that to an article would be WP:OR, so we won't do that - we do when it's Bede's years because people have discussed it in print, but this they haven't - but we can take it into consideration here when deciding what to do. 
The Chronicle of Ireland was compiled from lots of sources and it would be a reasonable bet that even if most or nearly all of them started the year on 1 January, some would have done so on 25 December, some on 1 September, and some on 25 March. Even if Mc Carthy's system is perfect, you can only be entirely confident about the year if the event falls between 25 March and 31 August.
If we can date events to within a year either way, that's good, if we can date events in the 7th century to within 2 or 3 years, that's marvellous. If it were me, I'd go with """"historian"""" dates, i.e. what Byrne, Charles-Edwards and the rest say, and add Mc Carthy's corrections in a footnote, which is what is done with Penda of Mercia and other C7th Anglo-Saxons where there is a similar, but smaller, problem.

The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

Just logged into find loads of stuff about you.  It looks like it's getting harder for you having to do lots of edits, before your main edits.  Is it worth the effort x

Hello there, me old fruit!

It is true that it's getting harder for me with having to put in ten edits before I can use my accounts. They sometimes get spotted and blocked whilst I'm making the ten edits, especially if I've just used an account and especially if User:Hut 8.5's online. I have generally targeted a dormant user talk page or tagged my own sockpuppets to achieve the ten edits.

It is not too difficult yet. User:Raul654 has put in loads of IP rangeblocks which do restrict me. I can generally get on using BT.

There seems to be a concerted effort now by many different users to revert my edits quickly. I suppose a good measure of my effectiveness is the percentage of the time that my edits are visible, or whether the page is fully protected. That percentage is very low at the moment. VICS is fully protected, but Northwich Victoria F.C. and Witton Albion F.C. are not.

It is worth the effort; I still hate the whole Wikipedia concept of truth by consensus. I can cope with being reverted within minutes by many different editors, being checkusered regularly and blocked on sight. User:Raul654's checkuser investigations are only about 95 - 98% accurate in terms of percentage of accounts that he labels actually being me.

I have included your message to me because  routine.

I still think it's funny that people like to assert that I'm a banned user eg here despite the fact that .

 Addressing your concerns 

888fortune, I found your comments at Duke53's talk page that flesh out some of your concerns.  I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message.  I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.

If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.""""  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.

From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!""""  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.

You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.""""  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.

Does this satisfy any of your concerns?  I'm interested in your response.  /talk/ """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Response to help desk

Hi Rockingchick. Sorry your article was deleted, but it sounds like you were writing a biography of a non-notable person. We can't generally let people write articles about people they know or knew personally because it violates our policies of having everything verified by reliable sources (if you write about someone the wider world hasn't heard of we have no way of making sure what you wrote is true) and writing from a neutral point of view (you can't be neutral about someone you know personally). There are more specific guidelines as to who's considered notable at WP:BIO.

If you'd like some ideas for a good first article, you can try the Your first article (which is more a list of """"don't""""s) and the Requested articles pages. The community portal also has lots of other ways in which people can contribute to Wikipedia apart from writing new articles.

Hope this won't put you off editing Wikipedia, it can be quite hard to get stuck in at first, but don't worry - although sometimes it seems otherwise, people are always happy to put your mistakes right as long as you don't make a habit of repeating them.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Hi, Thumperward. The reason I reverted your edit is because there are dozens of articles using the template which do not have a specific value for the CoA width parameter, based on the assumption that the default width was 120px. When you removed this default width value, many templates suddenly found themselves with HUGE coats of arms, which were visually striking and quite ugly. Therefore, I believe the default width of 120px should be kept. If you wish to remove it entirely, then you should first ensure that all the articles using the template have a specific value for the width parameter. Regards.",0,0,0,0,0,0,

 Questionable """"Unresolved Disruptive Technologies"""" 

Some of the examples of """"unresolved"""" technologies promoted as disruptive cannot honestly be considered """"unresolved"""".  The most glaring of these is """"e-commerce vs. physical shops"""".  It is absolutely clear that both e-commerce and physical shops are completely entrenched in their own respective niches, and while there is a lot of competition between them in some areas, the idea that either one could entirely supplant and eliminate the other in the forseeable future* is lunacy.  Similar arguments apply to """"free / open-source vs. proprietary software"""" and """"Internet Video on Demand and IPTV vs. Advertising supported broadcast and cable television"""".

The examples of """"Music downloads and File sharing vs. compact discs"""", """"ebooks vs. paper books"""", and """"VoIP (and VoIP over 802.11) vs. traditional telephone and mobile phone service"""" are much better examples of """"unresolved"""" potentially disruptive technologies.

""""forseeable future"""" in this case refers to the current world we live in, free from instantaneous teleportation, William Gibson-style """"simstim"""", and other similarly sci-fi developements.

0f63f20906eef7c0,"""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.

The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:
""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. 

The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.

Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers- la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.

Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

IIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.
